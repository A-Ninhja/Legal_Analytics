*CLEME:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice , and may it please the Court : +/.
50	@G:	---
51	*CLEME:	When a Federal Government agency compelled employers to provide
52		something as religiously sensitive as contraception , it knew that free
53		exercise in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] claims would soon follow .
54	@G:	---
55	*CLEME:	In particular , the agency itself provided exemptions and
56		accommodations for the religious exercise of a subset +/.
57	*SOTO:	Is your claim limited to sensitive materials like contraceptives or
58		does it include items like blood transfusion , vaccines ?
59	*SOTO:	For some religions , products made of pork ?
60	*SOTO:	Is any claim under your theory that has a religious basis , could an
61		employer preclude the use of those items as well ?
62	*CLEME:	+, Well , Justice Sotomayor , the first step in the analysis would be
63		to ask whether or not there's a substantial burden on religious
64		exercise .
65	@G:	---
66	*CLEME:	I do think this case is , in a sense , easier than most of the examples
67		that you've brought up because here's one where it's so religiously
68		sensitive , so fraught with religious controversy , that the agency
69		itself provides a certain number of exemptions and accommodations .
70	*CLEME:	So that's one way , I think , that you'd address the first step of the
71		question here .
72	*KAGA:	Well , I mean , just take one of the things that Justice Sotomayor
73		asked about , which is vaccinations , because there are many people who
74		have religious objections to vaccinations .
75	*KAGA:	So suppose an employer does and (.) and refuses to fund or wants not to
76		fund vaccinations for her employees , what (.) what happens then ?
77	*CLEME:	Well , if we assume we get past the substantial burden step of the
78		analysis , then the next step of the analysis is the compelling
79		interest and least restrictive alternatives analysis .
80	*CLEME:	And every case would have to be analyzed on its own .
81	*CLEME:	I do think in the context of vaccinations , the government may have a
82		stronger compelling interest than it does in this context because there
83		are notions of herd immunity and the like that give the government a
84		particularly compelling interest in trying to maximize the number +/.
85	*KAGA:	Blood transfusions ?
86	*CLEME:	+, Blood transfusions .
87	*CLEME:	Again , each one of these cases , I think would have to be evaluated on
88		its own and apply the compelling interest-least restrictive alternative
89		test and the substantial burdens part of the test .
90	*KAGA:	So really , every medical treatment .
91	*KAGA:	And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that there are quite a number of
92		medical treatments that difference religious groups object to .
93	*KAGA:	So one religious group could opt out of this and another religious
94		group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and
95		nothing would be uniform .
96	*CLEME:	Well (.) well , Justice Kagan , nothing could be clearer than when
97		Congress passed <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] Congress made a judgment that
98		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] was going to apply to all manner of Federal
99		statutes .
100	*CLEME:	And I think what the Congress +/.
101	*GINS:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , maybe it seemed clear then , but since
102		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , just as before <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , Congress has
103		continued to write into Federal legislation specific religious
104		exemptions for some , but not everybody , for individuals , sometimes
105		religious institutions .
106	*GINS:	So if it was all that clear that <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] took care of it
107		all , why did Congress continue after <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] to pass these
108		laws focusing the exemption on an individual , religious institution ?
109	*GINS:	Those , as I take your argument , all of those laws (.) and there are
110		more than half a dozen (.) were unnecessary .
111	*GINS:	Once <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] was on the books , Congress didn't have to do
112		that any more .
113	*CLEME:	+, Well , Justice Ginsburg , I'm not sure that they were all
114		unnecessary .
115	*CLEME:	And of course , in a variety of contexts , Congress may proceed on a
116		belt and suspenders matters .
117	*CLEME:	So I think there's really two different questions .
118	*CLEME:	One is when Congress passed <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , was <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA]
119		just done with creating other exemptions .
120	*CLEME:	And I think the answer to that is no .
121	*CLEME:	But I think the question that Justice Kagan's question brought up is ,
122		was Congress evident and did Congress specifically consider whether
123		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] would apply across the board to all the provisions
124		of <eighteen> [= 18] <U_S_C> [= U.S.C.] , or rather all the provisions of
125		the United States Code .
126	*CLEME:	And Congress could not have been clearer that it was passing a statute
127		that it wanted to apply to all preexisting statutes and to all
128		subsequent statutes unless Congress specifically provided otherwise .
129	*KENN:	You were beginning by giving us a framework for your argument .
130	*KENN:	Do I think of this as a statutory case ?
131	*KENN:	Of course , the First Amendment is on the stage at some point here ,
132		but I take it you can prevail just on the question of statutory
133		interpretation , and if that is so , are there any statutory rules that
134		work in your favor , that is to say , avoiding a constitutional
135		question or how do we think about this case , primarily as a statutory
136		case ?
137	*CLEME:	Obviously , one of my clients has before you right now a free exercise
138		claim and my other client has a free exercise claim that's live in the
139		lower courts .
140	*CLEME:	So those issues are preserved .
141	*CLEME:	But I , think , as your question points out , this Court really , first
142		and foremost , can decide this on the basis of the Federal statute ,
143		and the Ashwander principles of constitutional avoidance seem like they
144		would be sort of fully applicable to the Court's consideration of that
145		question .
146	*CLEME:	And then , of course , the normal principles of statutory construction
147		would certainly point you to the answer to the first objection the
148		government raises , which is do persons include for-profit corporations
149		because +/.
150	*KAGA:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , isn't this a special kind of statute ?
151	*KAGA:	Because this is a statute that specifically refers back to a body of
152		constitutional law .
153	*KAGA:	It basically says we want to get right back to the place that we were
154		with respect to religious claims before Employment Division <v@l> [=
155		v.] Smith .
156	*KAGA:	And so we have (.) it's not (.) you know , it's a statute that directs
157		us to a body of constitutional law .
158	@G:	---
159	*KAGA:	That body of constitutional law is , I think , very different from the
160		one you portray in your brief .
161	@G:	---
162	*KAGA:	It suggests that accommodations should be made sometimes , but rarely ,
163		and subject to a (.) to a balancing analysis , not to a compelling
164		interest standard in the way we would use it for , say , race
165		discrimination .
166	*KAGA:	So , you know , what's (.) what's the response to that ?
167	*CLEME:	+, Well , first , Justice Kagan , let me take a little bit of an issue
168		with your premise and let me try to responsive to your question anyways
169		after I do that .
170	*CLEME:	How I'd like to take issue with your premise is that when Congress
171		first passed the statute <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , it talked about free
172		exercise as defined in the Court's cases .
173	*CLEME:	And then at the time that it passed <R_L_U_I_P_A> [= RLUIPA] , which is
174		a later statute , it actually confronted some lower court cases that
175		had limited <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] and tried to impose a centrality
176		requirement .
177	*CLEME:	And Congress didn't want that .
178	*CLEME:	It didn't want to take all the baggage of the pre-Smith free exercise
179		cases .
180	*CLEME:	So it actually amended the statute to broaden it so it now protects any
181		exercise of religion .
182	*CLEME:	So I would take issue with your premise that <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] simply
183		picks up everything that ever happened pre-Smith .
184	*SCAL:	Well , there (.) there's another respect in which this , even as
185		originally enacted , does not track the (.) the preemployment Division
186		<v@l> [= v.] Smith law .
187	*SCAL:	That is to say , the (.) the compelling State interest test in the
188		prior cases was never accompanied by a least restrictive alternative
189		requirement .
190	*SCAL:	That was an invention of this (.) of this law .
191	*CLEME:	I think that's fair , Justice Scalia .
192	*CLEME:	One of the things that you run into if you try to sort of get at this
193		statute the way that Justice Kagan is suggesting is that not everybody
194		exactly agreed as to what the pre-Smith case law was .
195	*CLEME:	You described the pre-Smith case law in your opinion in a certain way .
196	@G:	---
197	*CLEME:	Justice O'Connor described the pre-Smith case law in another way .
198	*CLEME:	So it's a little bit difficult to try to say , as Justice Kagan's
199		question would suggest , that rather than just apply the statute as
200		written , we should really sort of just go back and apply pre-Smith
201		laws if this were +/.
202	*KAGA:	Well , it is applying the statute as written .
203	*KAGA:	The statute as written (.) this is not a question of legislative
204		history (.) the statute as written points back to pre-Smith law .
205	*KAGA:	It says : That's what we mean .
206	*CLEME:	+, Well , you're right , Justice Kagan , in the purpose part of the
207		statute it says : What we mean to do here is basically restore the
208		pre-Smith law .
209	*CLEME:	But it also accompanies that purpose statute with operative language .
210	*CLEME:	And the operative language , which I think this Court should apply , as
211		Justice Scalia suggests , applies broadly to any exercise of religion
212		by any person and then suggests that the relevant test is substantial
213		burden with the burden on my client as to the substantial burden part
214		of the test .
215	*CLEME:	And then it's +/.
216	*GINS:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , this (.) this was a law that was passed
217		overwhelmingly , both houses of Congress .
218	*GINS:	People from all sides of the political spectrum voted for it .
219	*GINS:	It seems strange that there would have been that tremendous uniformity
220		if it means what you said it means , to take (.) to cover profit
221		corporations , especially in light of (.) there was an effort to adopt
222		a conscience amendment , a specific conscience amendment in <two thousand and twelve> [= 2012] , and the Senate rejected that .
223	*GINS:	That (.) that amendment would have enabled secular employers and
224		insurance providers to deny coverage on the basis of religious beliefs
225		or moral convictions .
226	*GINS:	It was specifically geared to secular employers and insurance
227		providers .
228	*GINS:	And that (.) that was rejected .
229	*CLEME:	+, Well , Justice Ginsburg , I would suggest to the contrary .
230	*CLEME:	The reason that there was such unanimity behind <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] in
231		the first place is that efforts to limit it to just certain
232		subclasses , subsets of religious freedom claims , were rejected and
233		sort of everybody in Congress got together and said , all right , you
234		have some claims you actually want to be vindicated , you have some
235		claims you want to be vindicated , we'll vindicate all of them .
236	*CLEME:	And if we're going to look at any legislative history as shedding light
237		on this , then I would suggest you look at Professor Laycock's brief ,
238		which goes into great detail about the legislative debates involved in
239		(.) that led up ultimately to the passage of <R_L_U_I_P_A> [= RLUIPA] .
240	*CLEME:	And when Congress was trying to pass a broader statute , the <R_L_P_A>
241		[= RLPA] , the Religious Liberty Protection Act , the issue of the
242		statute's application and <R_F_R_A's> [= RFRA's] application to
243		for-profit corporations was squarely put at issue by the Nadler
244		Amendment .
245	*CLEME:	And that amendment was rejected and the House report that demonstrates
246		the rejection of that amendment could not be clearer that they
247		understood that for-profit corporations would be covered .
248	@G:	---
249	*CLEME:	Now , in fairness , what they understood is that we were probably
250		talking about in the real world a relatively small set of corporations
251		like an incorporated kosher market or kosher deli of the kind that this
252		Court had before it in the Crown Kosher case .
253	@G:	---
254	*CLEME:	And so I think it's (.) you know , we can talk about the extent and how
255		you'd apply these principles to Exxon , but I think that's just
256		something that's not going to happen in the real world .
257	*CLEME:	It is no accident that the claims that you have before you in these
258		cases are brought by small closely-held corporations that have firmly
259		held religious beliefs .
260	*KAGA:	But , again , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement as Justice Ginsburg said , this
261		was a very uncontroversial law .
262	*KAGA:	Your understanding of this law , your interpretation of it , would
263		essentially subject the entire <U_S> [= U.S.] Code to the highest test
264		in constitutional law , to a compelling interest standard .
265	*KAGA:	So another employer comes in and that employer says , I have a
266		religious objection to sex discrimination laws ; and then another
267		employer comes in , I have a religious objection to minimum wage laws ;
268		and then another , family leave ; and then another , child labor laws .
269	*KAGA:	And all of that is subject to the exact same test which you say is this
270		unbelievably high test , the compelling interest standard with the
271		least restrictive alternative .
272	*CLEME:	Well , I don't say that .
273	*CLEME:	I think Congress said that .
274	*CLEME:	But to be as responsive as I can to your question , the parade of
275		horribles that the government offers you ought to sound familiar ,
276		because if you look at that parade of horribles (.) Social Security ,
277		minimum wage , discrimination laws , compelled vaccination (.) every
278		item on that list was included in Justice Scalia's opinion for the
279		Court in Smith .
280	*CLEME:	And Justice O'Connor responded to that in her separate opinion and she
281		said , look , you've got to trust the courts ; just because free
282		exercise claims are being brought doesn't mean that the courts can't
283		separate the sheep from the goats .
284	*CLEME:	Now , whatever +/.
285	*KAGA:	Well , she had an understanding of how the Court worked pre-Smith that
286		was a kind of Sherbert <v@l> [= v.] Verner-Yoder understanding , which
287		was we did a balancing , we looked at the government's interests , we
288		took those very seriously , especially to the extent that there was
289		harm to identifiable third parties and that it fell on an identifiable
290		third party .
291	@G:	---
292	*KAGA:	That was basically (.) you could not get an accommodation for that kind
293		of harm .
294	*CLEME:	+, Well , what she said and whatever the merits of it as a matter of
295		constitutional debate isn't relevant .
296	*CLEME:	What (.) what I think is relevant is that Congress clearly preferred
297		one side of that debate and thought courts could handle this .
298	@G:	---
299	*CLEME:	So then the question becomes : How do courts actually apply this test ?
300	*CLEME:	And I don't think applying the test to recognize this case , where I
301		think the government has an incredibly weak case on compelling interest
302		and least restrictive alternatives , which they almost don't want to
303		talk about at all , is going to endanger any other statutes .
304	*CLEME:	And if I could talk about specific +/.
305	*ALIT:	Well , could I ask you this , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement .
306	*ALIT:	In (.) in all the years since <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] has been on the
307		books , has any of these claims involving minimum wage , for example ,
308		been brought and have they succeeded ?
309	*CLEME:	+, Justice Alito , very few of these claims have been brought .
310	*CLEME:	Very few of them have succeeded , and that's notwithstanding the fact
311		that all of these statutes we're talking about apply to employers
312		generally .
313	*CLEME:	And it (.) and none of those claims have been brought or they haven't
314		succeeded notwithstanding the fact that the government concedes that
315		sole proprietorships and partnerships and nonprofit corporations are
316		all protected by <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
317	@G:	---
318	*CLEME:	Now , millions of Americans are employed by proprietorships ,
319		partnerships , and nonprofits .
320	*CLEME:	So if these statutes really were on a collision course , I think we
321		would have seen the collision already .
322	*KAGA:	Well , with respect , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , I think that that's
323		probably because the Court has had a different understanding of what
324		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] does and the kind of analysis that it requires
325		courts to perform than you're arguing for in this case .
326	*KAGA:	That if your argument were adopted and there was a strict scrutiny
327		standard of the kind that usually applies and a least restrictive
328		alternative requirement , then you would see religious objectors come
329		out of the woodwork with respect to all of these laws .
330	*KAGA:	And because you say that there (.) and I think this is absolutely right
331		when you say it (.) that you (.) you cannot test the centrality of a
332		belief to a religion , you cannot test the sincerity of religion .
333	*KAGA:	I think a court would be , you know (.) their hands would be bound when
334		faced with all these challenges if your standard applies .
335	*CLEME:	Well , Justice Kagan , a couple of thoughts .
336	*CLEME:	First of all , I mean , it's not like this Court has never had a
337		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] case that it applied the standard on the merits .
338	*CLEME:	And in the O Centro case , this Court applied something that very much
339		felt to the government at the time as being strict scrutiny .
340	*CLEME:	But if this Court +/.
341	*GINS:	Well , It was a religious organization .
342	*CLEME:	+, It certainly was a religious organization and it's a separate
343		question as +/.
344	*GINS:	This is (.) this is what's different .
345	*GINS:	I mean , all along the earlier cases dealt with individuals and they
346		dealt with religious institutions .
347	*CLEME:	+, Well , if I may , Justice Ginsburg , there's two separate
348		questions .
349	*CLEME:	There's a question about how to apply the test if it's applicable in a
350		particular case , and I think O Centro is the starting place for
351		guidance on that .
352	@G:	---
353	*CLEME:	Your question also brings up the separate question about the coverage
354		of the statute .
355	*CLEME:	And as to that , I think the place to start is the statute itself ,
356		which broadly provides coverages to persons .
357	*CLEME:	That is not an incidental term .
358	*CLEME:	It's a term that picks up additional context through the Dictionary Act
359		and specifically applies to all corporations , to joint partnerships ,
360		to societies .
361	*SOTO:	How does a corporation exercise religion ?
362	*SOTO:	I mean , I know how it speaks and we have , according to our
363		jurisprudence , <two hundred> [= 200] years of corporations speaking in its
364		own interests .
365	*SOTO:	But where are the cases that show that a corporation exercises
366		religion ?
367	*CLEME:	Well , Justice Sotomayor , those (.) those cases (.) I mean , I'd start
368		with cases like Lukumi or O Centro , which all involved corporations ,
369		and nobody thought it was particularly problematic there that the
370		plaintiffs before the court were artificial entities .
371	*CLEME:	And I suppose you could take +/.
372	*SOTO:	Well , but they were really arguing about things that affected their
373		membership , not them as a corporate entity .
374	*CLEME:	+, Well , I'm not sure that you can so easily divide the two , and we
375		can talk about how it is with corporations generally .
376	*CLEME:	You understand how the corporation has certain beliefs or certain
377		intent , a scienter requirement .
378	*CLEME:	The courts every day deal with issues of trying to figure out what kind
379		of intent or motivation a corporate entity has .
380	*SOTO:	So the dissent in this case , in the Tenth Circuit case , said how do
381		we determine when a corporation has that belief ?
382	*SOTO:	Who says it ?
383	*SOTO:	The majority of shareholders ?
384	*SOTO:	The corporate officers ?
385	*SOTO:	The (.) is it <fifty-one> [= 51] percent ?
386	*SOTO:	What happens to the minority ?
387	*SOTO:	And how much of the business has to be dedicated to religion ?
388	*SOTO:	<five> [= 5] percent ?
389	*SOTO:	<ten> [= 10] percent ?
390	*SOTO:	<ninety> [= 90] percent ?
391	*SOTO:	Just assume not a business like yours (.) you picked great plaintiffs ,
392		but let's assume (.) +/.
393	*SOTO:	0 &=laughter .
394	*SOTO:	Let's assume just a business that sells <five> [= 5] percent of
395		religious books , doesn't play Christmas music , doesn't give off (.)
396		works on Sunday , you know , does nothing else religiously .
397	*CLEME:	Right .
398	*CLEME:	And , Justice Sotomayor , I think the way to approach those cases would
399		be the same basic way you approach other questions of corporate intent
400		or corporate motivation .
401	*CLEME:	You look to the governance doctrines , if any of this is put at issue .
402	*CLEME:	And I think that's really a critical question , which is ultimately , I
403		think this line of questioning goes to a question of sincerity , and if
404		some large corporation asserts some claim that's going to save them
405		lots of money , I would think that the government in those kind of
406		cases is really going to resist the sincerity piece of the analysis .
407	*CLEME:	In this kind of case +/.
408	*SOTO:	That's the most dangerous piece .
409	*SOTO:	That's the one we've resisted in all our exercise jurisprudence , to
410		measure the depth of someone's religious beliefs .
411	*CLEME:	+, To be clear , this Court's cases have always distinguished between
412		the sincerity inquiry , which the Court has allowed , and the
413		centrality inquiry , which it suggested is inappropriate .
414	*CLEME:	But sincerity has always been a part of this Court's cases .
415	*SOTO:	I thought more importantly was whether a burden was substantial or
416		not .
417	@G:	---
418	*SOTO:	That we've never acceded to the person claiming a religious exemption ,
419		a belief in how substantial the burden might be .
420	*CLEME:	Right .
421	*CLEME:	This Court has not questioned that .
422	*CLEME:	The Thomas case , I think , puts as common ground the idea that you
423		don't really second-guess the person's (.) the person's belief , but
424		you can contest sincerity .
425	*CLEME:	It is (.) there is case law in this .
426	*CLEME:	You know , you have people who are arrested in possession of large
427		quantities of marijuana and they assert that they belong to the church
428		of marijuana , and those cases do get litigated and they get rejected .
429	*CLEME:	And there's a lot of different ways to +/.
430	*SOTO:	Is there (.) is there a different way of looking at it , the leeway ?
431	*SOTO:	In <U_S> [= U.S.] <v@l> [= v.] Lee , we said , +"/.
432	*SOTO:	+" When followers of a particular sect enter into a commercial activity
433		as a matter of choice , the limits they accept on their own conduct as
434		a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the
435		statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity .
436	@G:	---
437	*SOTO:	So isn't that really the answer , that we've never considered a
438		for-profit corporation as exercising religion ?
439	*CLEME:	+, Well , let me (.) let me take on Lee first .
440	*CLEME:	And I mean , that's obviously the two lines of Lee that are the
441		government's favorite two lines in Lee .
442	*CLEME:	But Lee starts with a substantial burden inquiry , which is where most
443		of these sincerity questions go .
444	@G:	---
445	*CLEME:	And Lee definitely says that there is a sincere religious belief and a
446		substantial burden on religious exercise .
447	@G:	---
448	*CLEME:	So the two sentences that you're quoting come in the compelling
449		interest analysis of the case .
450	@G:	---
451	*CLEME:	And I think Lee does stand for the proposition that in the tax
452		context , it's going to be very hard for somebody to bring a claim that
453		satisfies even the demanding compelling interest , least restrictive
454		alternative test .
455	*SOTO:	Well , that's an interesting question , because the briefs on both
456		sides here are written as if the penalty for not having a health
457		insurance policy that covers contraceptives is at issue .
458	*SOTO:	But isn't there another choice nobody talks about , which is paying the
459		tax , which is a lot less than a penalty and a lot less than (.) than
460		the cost of health insurance at all ?
461	*SOTO:	These employers could choose not to give health insurance and pay not
462		that high a penalty (.) not that high a tax .
463	*CLEME:	Well , just to put this in concrete terms , for Hobby Lobby , for
464		example , the choice is between paying a <five hundred> [= 500] (.) a <four seventy-five million dollars> [= $475 million] per year penalty and paying a <twenty-six million dollars> [= $26 million] per year coverage .
465	*KAGA:	No , I don't think that that's the same thing , <Mister> [= Mr.]
466		Clement .
467	*KAGA:	There's one penalty that is if the employer continues to provide health
468		insurance without this part of the coverage , but Hobby Lobby could
469		choose not to provide health insurance at all .
470	*KAGA:	And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000]
471		per employee , which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays to provide
472		insurance to its employees .
473	@G:	---
474	*KAGA:	So there is a choice here .
475	*KAGA:	It's not even a penalty by (.) in the language of the statute .
476	*KAGA:	It's a payment or a tax .
477	*KAGA:	There's a choice .
478	*KAGA:	And so the question is , why is there a substantial burden at all ?
479	*CLEME:	Well , just to be clear , we were talking about the same thing .
480	*CLEME:	So the option , the choice , is between paying a <four seventy-five million dollars> [= $475 million] a year penalty and a <twenty-six million dollars> [= $26 million] a year
481		penalty .
482	*CLEME:	That's what Hobby Lobby faces .
483	*CLEME:	So <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] per person +/.
484	*KAGA:	No , between paying <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] per employee per
485		year if Hobby Lobby does not provide +/.
486	*CLEME:	+, That's <twenty-six million dollars> [= $26 million] .
487	*KAGA:	+, You know , Hobby Lobby is paying something right now for the (.) for
488		the coverage .
489	@G:	---
490	*KAGA:	It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the coverage .
491	*KAGA:	There are employers all over the United States that are doing this
492		voluntarily because they think that it's less .
493	*ROBE:	I thought (.) I thought that part of the religious commitment of the
494		owners was to provide health care for its employees .
495	*CLEME:	That is true , <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice .
496	*CLEME:	It is also true that this +/.
497	*SOTO:	Well , if they want to do that , they can just pay a greater salary and
498		let the employees go in on the exchange .
499	*CLEME:	+, Exactly , which is , by the way , why comparing the <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] penalty to the cost of the health care is a
500		false (.) it's a false comparison .
501	*SOTO:	It's not called a penalty .
502	*SOTO:	It's called a tax .
503	*SOTO:	And it's calibrated (.) and it's calibrated +/.
504	*ROBE:	She's right about that .
505	@G:	---
506	*ROBE:	0 &=laughter .
507	*CLEME:	And it has been treated for some purposes as a penalty .
508	*CLEME:	And I think for this purposes , it certainly feels punitive .
509	@G:	---
510	*CLEME:	And if I could finish the thought about why it's a false comparison ,
511		the <two thousand> [= 2,000] penalty to the cost of the health
512		insurance , is that it's going to very much hurt Hobby Lobby if all of
513		the sudden it doesn't provide health care to its employees .
514	*CLEME:	And in order to compensate for that , it would have to increase the
515		wages .
516	*CLEME:	And I think it would be worse off as a result of this .
517	*CLEME:	But if I could also +/.
518	*KAGA:	Well , let's say that that's right .
519	*KAGA:	Let's say that they have to increase the wages a little bit .
520	*KAGA:	I mean , still we are talking about pretty equivalent numbers .
521	*KAGA:	Maybe it's a little bit less ; maybe it's a little bit more .
522	*KAGA:	But this is not the kind of thing that's going to drive a person out of
523		business .
524	@G:	---
525	*KAGA:	It's not prohibitive .
526	@G:	---
527	*KAGA:	It's like the thing that we talked about in Braunfeld where we said ,
528		you know , maybe if the store can't stay open <seven> [= 7] days a week ,
529		it makes a little bit less money .
530	*KAGA:	But so be it , is what we said .
531	*CLEME:	+, No , I actually think what it's like , Your Honor , with all due
532		respect , it's like the five dollar penalty enforcing the prohibition
533		in Yoder .
534	@G:	---
535	*CLEME:	And what this Court says , it's one thing if you don't have a direct
536		government prohibition on a religious exercise or a mandate that
537		somebody do something that violates their religion .
538	*CLEME:	In those cases , which is like Sherbert and is like Braunfeld , then
539		you have to look at the substantial pressure , and it becomes a little
540		bit more of a loosey-goosey analysis .
541	*CLEME:	But when you have a government law that specifically says you must do
542		something that violates your religion (.) and it's enforced with a
543		penalty , and with all due respect I think <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] per employee is a penalty .
544	*KAGA:	But <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , it's not saying you must do something
545		that violates your religion .
546	*KAGA:	It's giving you a choice .
547	*KAGA:	You can do this thing or if this thing violates your religion you can
548		do another thing .
549	*KAGA:	And that other thing is approximately the same price as the thing that
550		you don't want to do .
551	*CLEME:	I don't think it would be the same price at the end of the day .
552	*CLEME:	I'd also like to point out how this +/.
553	*SCAL:	Well , of course it wouldn't be the same price at the end of the day .
554	*SCAL:	If they deny health insurance , they're going to have to raise wages if
555		they are going to get employees .
556	*CLEME:	+, Absolutely .
557	*SCAL:	It's absurd to say that , you know , it comes out of nowhere .
558	*CLEME:	Absolutely , Your Honor .
559	*CLEME:	And by the way , this <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] penalty is very
560		much a double-edged sword for the government , because you're trying to
561		(.) J +/.
562	*KENN:	But why (.) why is that a problem ?
563	*KENN:	Let's assume that the cost of providing insurance is roughly equivalent
564		to the <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000] penalty .
565	@G:	---
566	*KENN:	How (.) how is the employer hurt ?
567	*KENN:	He can just raise the wages .
568	*SOTO:	+, May I just put a footnote on this .
569	*SOTO:	I thought the average price of providing insurance for a single person
570		is <four thousand dollars> [= $4,000] , and it's <twelve thousand dollars> [= $12,000] for a family (.) for a family .
571	*SOTO:	So the <two thousand> [= 2,000] tax (.) that's what it's called (.) is
572		to help the government provide subsidies to people on the exchange that
573		don't have employer insurance .
574	*SOTO:	So it's a tax because it's (.) it is to do exactly what your client
575		wants , to get the government to supply the contraceptives , not the
576		insurance companies .
577	*CLEME:	+, Here's the problem with this way of looking at it , which is to say
578		whatever it costs per employee to get this , this health care , that's
579		something that right now Hobby Lobby is paying whatever it's paying
580		them , plus it's (.) it's (.) you know , imputed into that is the idea
581		that they're getting their wage and they're getting health care
582		insurance .
583	@G:	---
584	*CLEME:	If they take away the health care insurance , they are going to have to
585		increase the wages to make up for that .
586	*CLEME:	And they're going to have to pay the <two thousand dollars> [= $2,000]
587		penalty on top of it , plus they're going to have to violate their (.)
588		their own interest which is , we actually (.) we believe it's important
589		to provide our employees with qualified health care .
590	*KENN:	Okay , the last is important .
591	*KENN:	But just assume hypothetically that it's a wash , that the employer
592		would be in about the same position if he paid the penalty and the
593		employer (.) pardon me , an employee went out and got the insurance and
594		that the employee's wages were raised slightly and then it's (.) and
595		that it's a wash so far as the employer are concerned , other than the
596		employer's religious objection , but just on the financial standpoint .
597	*KENN:	Can we assume that as a hypothetical .
598	*KENN:	Then what would your case be ?
599	*CLEME:	I think my case would be that in that case the government might be able
600		to sort of support itself on the compelling interest .
601	*CLEME:	I think there would still be a substantial burden on their exercise .
602	*CLEME:	But again , this all turns on issues that the government hasn't put in
603		issue .
604	*CLEME:	This case hasn't been litigated on this particular theory , so I think
605		(.) I'd love to have the opportunity to show how by not providing
606		health insurance it would have a huge burden on my client and their
607		ability to attract workers , and that in fact would cost them much more
608		out of pocket .
609	@G:	---
610	*CLEME:	But that's not been the nature of the government's theory .
611	*KAGA:	Can I ask +/.
612	*GINS:	There was a point made earlier , and I think you didn't mean to say
613		this , that provision of health care is not part of their religious
614		belief .
615	*GINS:	Covering their employees for health care , that is not a religious
616		tenet , right ?
617	*CLEME:	No , it actually is .
618	*CLEME:	Again , it hasn't been the principal theory on which this case has been
619		litigated .
620	*CLEME:	But see , if you go back to the complaints and you go back to our
621		briefs , you know , it's part of the religious beliefs that both the
622		Hahns and the Greens have .
623	*CLEME:	They think it's actually important +/.
624	*KAGA:	+, But , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , you're not saying , are you , that
625		their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health care ?
626	*KAGA:	I thought that you were never making that claim .
627	*CLEME:	+, I didn't have to make that claim in the course of this litigation .
628	*CLEME:	What I'm pointing out , though , is for purposes of the substantial
629		burden analysis , it is perfectly appropriate to take into account that
630		the <two thousand> [= 2,000] (.) the <twenty-six million dollars> [= $26 million] in
631		fines they would pay would not be the only thing that they would lose
632		out if they are on that horn of the dilemma .
633	@G:	---
634	*CLEME:	They would also lose out all the additional wages they would have to
635		pay , and they would be in this position of not offering health care ,
636		which is something they believe is important for their religion as
637		well .
638	*KAGA:	You know , I'm sure they seem like very good employers .
639	*KAGA:	And I'm sure they want to be good employers .
640	*KAGA:	But again , that's a different thing than saying that their religious
641		beliefs mandate them to provide health insurance , because here
642		Congress has said that the health insurance that they're providing is
643		not adequate , it's not the full package .
644	*CLEME:	Well , with respect , what Congress has said is that this kind of plan
645		is not appropriate for a non-grandfathered plan .
646	*CLEME:	But if we're going to talk about the government's compelling interests
647		here , which I think has got to be part of the analysis , then I think
648		the grandfathered provisions of this statute really are devastating for
649		the government's argument that it has a compelling interest .
650	@G:	---
651	*CLEME:	When the government pursues compelling interest , it demands immediate
652		compliance .
653	*CLEME:	It doesn't say , +"/.
654	*CLEME:	+" Get around to it whenever it's convenient .
655	*CLEME:	I can't imagine Congress passing Title <V_I_I> [= VII] and saying
656		, +"/.
657	*CLEME:	+" Stop discriminating on the basis of race , unless of course you have
658		a preexisting policy that discriminates on the basis of race , and then
659		you can keep it as long as you'd like .
660	@G:	---
661	*CLEME:	It is fundamentally inconsistent with a compelling interest +/.
662	*KAGA:	Well , but I think even +/.
663	*CLEME:	+, analysis to have this kind of grandfathering .
664	*KAGA:	+, that example , you know , initially Title <V_I_I> [= VII] did not
665		apply to any employers with fewer than <twenty-five> [= 25] employees .
666	*KAGA:	And then gradually , Congress brought the number down because Congress
667		realized that there were going to be transition issues and that some
668		time was needed to make sure that the compelling interest , you know ,
669		should be applied uniformly across all employers .
670	*CLEME:	Here's , respectfully , why I don't think that that works , which is I
671		think the question whenever there are exemptions in the statute is to
672		ask yourself , do the exemptions undermine the compelling interest that
673		the government asserts .
674	@G:	---
675	*CLEME:	There's nothing inconsistent with an interest in prohibiting employment
676		discrimination to say we're going to focus on the people who actually
677		employ the most people and therefore can engage in the most
678		discrimination .
679	@G:	---
680	*CLEME:	It's quite a different matter , and I don't think anybody would think
681		that Congress would pass a Title <V_I_I> [= VII] that said , +"/.
682	*CLEME:	+" Hey , as long as you have a preexisting discriminatory policy ,
683		you're allowed to keep it .
684	*CLEME:	That doesn't seem like it would be consistent .
685	*SOTO:	Counsel , your attorney (.) one of the attorneys below on behalf of
686		your clients admitted that the grandfathered policies weren't going to
687		be around very long because any change to an existing policy (.) and he
688		said these changes happen on a yearly basis .
689	*SOTO:	And we already know from the government's statistics that it's up to
690		<forty> [= 40] percent now have grandfathered out .
691	*SOTO:	Your own client changed its policy , and that's why it's not
692		grandfathered .
693	@G:	---
694	*SOTO:	And he changed it to drop contraceptives it was covering .
695	*CLEME:	Well +/.
696	*SOTO:	And so my point is , since when does a transitioned grandfathered
697		exemption and one that everybody knows will have to change , because
698		premiums by definition will change or co-pays will change , something
699		is going to change (.) it's a very short transition period .
700	*SOTO:	Since when does that prove that the need is not compelling ?
701	*CLEME:	+, With all due respect , it's not necessarily a very short transition
702		period .
703	*CLEME:	And your (.) your references to co-pays and premiums is precisely on
704		point , because the government , through its regulations , has allowed
705		grandfathered plans to make changes to the co-pays as long as they're
706		indexed to medical inflation .
707	@G:	---
708	*CLEME:	Now , if you have a transition period that's just there for a
709		nanosecond , you don't bother indexing it to medical inflation .
710	*CLEME:	So this is a grandfather provision that's going to be around for
711		multiple years .
712	@G:	---
713	*CLEME:	And by the government's own numbers , tens of millions of employees are
714		not getting this mandated coverage as a result of the grandfather
715		provision .
716	*CLEME:	And even if we can project forward ten years to when maybe there would
717		only be a handful of grandfathered plans , even at that point , you
718		would still have the same problem that the government would have ,
719		which is it has to make an argument for a compelling interest .
720	*KENN:	Just before your time starts to go too fast , how would you suggest
721		that we think about the position and the rights of the (.) of the
722		employees ?
723	*KENN:	And you can have hypotheticals about the employer makes them (.) wants
724		to make them wear burkas and so forth .
725	*KENN:	That's not in this case .
726	@G:	---
727	*KENN:	But in (.) in a way , the employees are in a position where the
728		government , through its healthcare plans , is (.) is , under your
729		view , is (.) is allowing the employer to put the employee in a
730		disadvantageous position .
731	*KENN:	The employee may not agree with these religious (.) religious beliefs
732		of the employer .
733	*KENN:	Does the religious beliefs just trump ?
734	*KENN:	Is that the way it works ?
735	*CLEME:	Well , no , it's not just the way it works , Justice Kennedy .
736	*CLEME:	And I actually have four things I'd like to say about that , if it's
737		possible .
738	@G:	---
739	*CLEME:	One is , I think the first thing about third-party burdens is you have
740		to ask where are they coming from .
741	*CLEME:	And if the third-party burdens are coming from an employer (.) I mean ,
742		an employer right now can put some burden on their rights because they
743		have to listen to religious music or whatever .
744	*CLEME:	That's not as serious as a burden that's coming directly from the
745		government .
746	*CLEME:	So that's one principle to think about .
747	@G:	---
748	*CLEME:	Another principle , and this is more of a detail , but I think it's
749		important , is that to the extent you take into account third-party
750		burdens , you take those into account in the compelling interest part
751		of the analysis .
752	*CLEME:	The government has an argument that somehow third-party interests go
753		into the substantial burden part of the analysis , where we bear the
754		burden .
755	@G:	---
756	*CLEME:	And we don't think that's right at all .
757	@G:	---
758	*CLEME:	The third-party +/.
759	*GINS:	But , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , you made the analogy to <R_L_U_I_P_A>
760		[= RLUIPA] .
761	*GINS:	And the one thing that has not been mentioned up till now is the
762		Establishment Clause .
763	*GINS:	The Court was very clear when it came to <R_L_U_I_P_A> [= RLUIPA] ,
764		which you said is similar to <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , that the
765		accommodation must be measured so it doesn't override other significant
766		interests .
767	*GINS:	And that was true of Sherbert and that was true of Yoder .
768	*GINS:	The (.) and the Cutter case , and this Court made it very clear , that
769		the accommodation has to be balanced and you have to take into account
770		other significant interests .
771	*CLEME:	+, Right .
772	*CLEME:	But that actually brings me to my third point , which is those other
773		significant interests that carry the most weight have to be independent
774		of the very statute that's at issue in the case and that the party
775		seeks an exemption from .
776	@G:	---
777	*CLEME:	So if you think about the Caldor case , there the Court was concerned
778		with the third-party burdens on , say , an employee who had a seniority
779		right to take the weekends off .
780	*CLEME:	So he or she had an independent right to take the weekend off , and the
781		government policy was coming in and displacing this .
782	*SOTO:	I'm not sure that (.) that squares with Lee .
783	*SOTO:	The (.) the statute created the right to Social Security , and there
784		the Court said you can't deprive employees of a statutory right because
785		of your religious beliefs .
786	*SOTO:	So Lee is contrary to the point you're making .
787	*CLEME:	There , too , I have to respectfully disagree , because if you remember
788		the facts of Lee , Lee is brought not just by the employer , but by the
789		employee .
790	*CLEME:	So the particular employees there don't have a beef with what he's
791		doing at all .
792	*CLEME:	And I think when they're talking about third-party burdens there , what
793		the Court is really talking about is the (.) the burdens of everybody
794		else who contributes into a system where uniformity , to use the
795		Court's words , was indispensable .
796	@G:	---
797	*CLEME:	And so if I could , though , I think , just to illustrate why it's sort
798		of double counting to count the mandated issue here as being what gives
799		the burden to the third party or the benefit on the third party .
800	@G:	---
801	*CLEME:	Imagine two hypotheticals .
802	*CLEME:	One is Congress passes a statute and says I have to destroy all of my
803		books , including my Bibles .
804	*CLEME:	Another statute , Congress comes in and says I have to give all of my
805		books , including all of my Bibles , to you .
806	@G:	---
807	*CLEME:	Now , in the second case , I suppose you could say that a <R_F_R_A> [=
808		RFRA] claim somehow gets rid of your statutory entitlement to my
809		Bibles , but I don't think , since it's the very benefit that we're
810		talking about that's at issue there , I don't think (.) I think that
811		really is double counting and I don't think those two hypothetical
812		statutes should be analyzed any differently .
813	@G:	---
814	*CLEME:	The other thing , though , about burdens , and I think it should go (.)
815		this is the fourth point (.) that should go into the compelling
816		interest test +/.
817	*KAGA:	I mean , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , isn't that just a way of saying
818		that you think that this isn't a good statute , because it asks one
819		person to subsidize another person .
820	*KAGA:	But Congress has made a judgment and Congress has given a statutory
821		entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive
822		coverage .
823	*KAGA:	And when the employer says , no , I don't want to give that , that
824		woman is quite directly , quite tangibly harmed .
825	*CLEME:	+, Well , Justice Kagan , I think you could say the same thing about my
826		Bible hypothetical .
827	@G:	---
828	*CLEME:	But I do have one last thing to say about burdens .
829	*CLEME:	And I do think when you think about impacts on third parties , not all
830		of these burdens are created equal .
831	*CLEME:	And that , too , I think is borne out in this Court's cases .
832	*CLEME:	And the most relevant factor is , is there some alternative way for the
833		government to ameliorate the burden .
834	@G:	---
835	*CLEME:	And I think about two types of , kind of accommodations , if you will .
836	*CLEME:	You get sort of Title <V_I_I> [= VII] with a very narrow
837		accommodation .
838	*CLEME:	And then you have conscience clauses that allow medical providers ,
839		including for-profit medical providers , not to provide abortions .
840	@G:	---
841	*CLEME:	Now , each of those has a burden on third parties , but I would
842		respectfully suggest they're different .
843	*CLEME:	In the case of the employee who's been subject to racial
844		discrimination , even if they can get another job , that racial
845		discrimination is a unique injury to them that you can't remedy unless
846		you tell the employer , don't discriminate on the basis of race .
847	@G:	---
848	*CLEME:	Now , in the context of the conscience clause , if a woman can't get an
849		abortion from her preferred provider , that's surely a significant
850		burden on her .
851	*CLEME:	But we don't view that as trumping the conscience clause , because she
852		can get the abortion through another mechanism .
853	@G:	---
854	*CLEME:	Here , as your question rightfully highlights , all we're really
855		talking about is who's going to pay for a subsidy that the government
856		prefers .
857	@G:	---
858	*CLEME:	This is not about access to the contraception .
859	*CLEME:	It's about who's going to pay for the government's preferred subsidy .
860	*CLEME:	And I think in that context , there are ample alternative ways to
861		address any burdens on third parties .
862	*CLEME:	And that goes right to the least +/.
863	*GINS:	It would make no difference if it were (.) there are <twenty> [= 20]
864		FDA-approved contraceptives , all of them covered by the Healthcare
865		Act .
866	*CLEME:	+, I think +/.
867	*GINS:	You (.) you picked out , in one case what , three , and the other case
868		four ?
869	*GINS:	Suppose the employer says contraceptives all together are against my
870		religion , so I'm not going to give any contraceptive coverage .
871	*CLEME:	+, Well , obviously , Justice Ginsburg , I didn't pick these out .
872	*CLEME:	I mean , my clients and their religious beliefs identified these as
873		problematic .
874	*CLEME:	There are certainly +/.
875	*GINS:	But your argument , it seems to me , would apply just as well if the
876		employer said no contraceptives .
877	*CLEME:	+, I think that's a fair point , Justice Ginsburg , and the
878		government's own accommodations , where they offer them to religious
879		groups and religious employers like nonprofit hospitals , also applies
880		to whatever the religious beliefs of that provider are .
881	*CLEME:	So if they extend to all <twenty> [= 20] , then the exemption's applied
882		to all <twenty> [= 20] .
883	*CLEME:	If they only extend to four , then the exemption applies to all four .
884	*ALIT:	Are there ways of accommodating the interests of the women who may want
885		these particular drugs or devices without imposing a substantial burden
886		on the employer who has the religious objection to it ?
887	*CLEME:	There are ample less restrictive alternatives , Your Honor .
888	*ALIT:	What are they ?
889	*CLEME:	And I think they all flow from this fact that this is ultimately about
890		who's going to pay for a substitute +/.
891	*SOTO:	Those are alternatives that you're asking the government to incur or
892		the person to incur .
893	*SOTO:	There isn't an alternative that doesn't put a cost on someone else .
894	*CLEME:	+, Well , it's (.) it's (.) it's funny about this particular mandate
895		because the government's position is this is actually a cost-free
896		mandate ; that whatever you pay out in contraceptions , you're going to
897		make up in not having to pay for other coverages .
898	*CLEME:	And so one alternative , one less restrictive alternative is what's
899		done in the accommodation for nonprofit employers like hospitals ,
900		where basically they tell the insurance carrier or the plan administer
901		that you pick up the cost for this and then essentially it'll be cost
902		neutral from you .
903	@G:	---
904	*CLEME:	But I don't think there's anything sort of sacrosanct , if you will ,
905		about having the government pay for its preferred subsidy as a less
906		restrictive alternative .
907	*CLEME:	And that's essentially what the government does for those employees who
908		have employers (.) under <fifty> [= 50] employers .
909	*CLEME:	If those employees (.) if the employer doesn't provide healthcare ,
910		those employees go on to the exchanges with a subsidy from the
911		government .
912	*CLEME:	Now , they can do the same thing for objecting religious employers .
913	@G:	---
914	*CLEME:	They just have chosen not to .
915	@G:	---
916	*CLEME:	If I may reserve my time .

922	*VERRI:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice , and may it please the Court : +/.
923	@G:	---
924	*VERRI:	The touchstone for resolving this case is the principle Justice Jackson
925		articulated in Prince <v@l> [= v.] +/.
926	@G:	---
927	*VERRI:	Massachusetts .
928	*VERRI:	As he said , +"/.
929	*VERRI:	+" Limitations which of necessity bound religious freedom begin to
930		operate whenever activities begin to affect or collide with the
931		liberties of others or of the public .
932	*VERRI:	+" Adherence to that principle is what makes possible the harmonious
933		functioning of a society like ours , in which people of every faith
934		live and work side by side .
935	*ROBE:	That's a statement that is inconsistent with <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , isn't
936		it ?
937	*ROBE:	The whole point of <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] is that Congress wanted to
938		provide exceptions for the religious views of particular (.) including
939		proprietors , individuals .
940	*VERRI:	No , <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice , I don't think so at all .
941	*VERRI:	In fact , the (.) although I was (.) of course , I was referring to
942		Justice Jackson's words for their wisdom because it wasn't the opinion
943		of the Court .
944	*VERRI:	But see , Jackson +/.
945	*ROBE:	Yeah .
946	*ROBE:	But the wisdom you cited is the idea that you don't have imposed , on
947		the basis of religious beliefs , exemptions or (.) or limitations .
948	*ROBE:	And it seems to me that was the whole point of <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , to
949		tell the courts that that is exactly what you should do unless the
950		exception satisfies the strict scrutiny test .
951	*VERRI:	+, Well , but I think (.) well , unless it satisfies the (.) the
952		pre-Smith standards under (.) under the Establishment Clause .
953	*VERRI:	But I do think that the exact same point +/.
954	*SCAL:	It's more than pre-Smith .
955	*VERRI:	+, I take your point +/.
956	*SCAL:	Plus +/.
957	*VERRI:	+, I take your point about less restrictive means , Your Honor .
958	*SCAL:	+, Okay .
959	*VERRI:	But the (.) the exact same point that Justice Jackson made in Prince ,
960		I submit , is the point that this Court made unanimously in Cutter .
961	@G:	---
962	*VERRI:	It's not (.) it's that when you are analyzing what is required under
963		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , the court must take account of the way in which
964		the requested accommodation will affect the rights and interests of
965		third parties .
966	*ALIT:	Well , is it your argument that providing the accommodation that's
967		requested here would violate the Establishment Clause ?
968	*VERRI:	It's not our argument that it would violate the Establishment Clause .
969	*VERRI:	But it is our argument that you (.) in any <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] case ,
970		including this one , you have to consider the impact on third parties ,
971		because otherwise , you will be skating on thin constitutional ice .
972	@G:	---
973	*VERRI:	And so Justice Kennedy , you asked about principles that (.) that
974		surround statutory construction .
975	@G:	---
976	*VERRI:	Avoidance is one of them .
977	*VERRI:	And that was why the Court unanimously in Cutter said that in every
978		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] case when you're considering an accommodation , you
979		have to weigh the effect on third parties .
980	*VERRI:	And that +/.
981	*SCAL:	Where (.) where is that in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] ?
982	*SCAL:	I mean , what (.) what factor of <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] do you fold that in
983		under ?
984	*SCAL:	Is (.) is that part of the compelling State interest requirement or (.)
985		or substantial burden requirement ?
986	*SCAL:	Where (.) where is it in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] ?
987	*VERRI:	+, I'd like (.) I think the answer is that it could inform every
988		operative provision in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
989	*VERRI:	We have said that it should inform the court's interpretation of who
990		counts as a person .
991	*SCAL:	If (.) if they wanted you to balance (.) balance the interest of the
992		religious objector against the interest of other individuals , they (.)
993		they made no reference to that in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] at all .
994	*VERRI:	Well , I +/.
995	*SCAL:	They said unless the government has a compelling State interest .
996	*VERRI:	+, And the compelling (.) and certainly compelling interest analysis
997		certainly does require consideration of the interests of third
998		parties .
999	@G:	---
1000	*VERRI:	Of course , what the court (.) what the Congress said in <R_F_R_A> [=
1001		RFRA] , in explaining how the compelling interest test was to work ,
1002		was that it was to strike a sensible balance between claims for
1003		religious liberty and governmental interests .
1004	@G:	---
1005	*VERRI:	And (.) and , of course , Lee is one of the pre-Smith cases that
1006		provides the governing law .
1007	*VERRI:	And I would submit it is really the only case from this Court in which
1008		the request for an exemption under the Free Exercise Clause had the
1009		effect of extinguishing a statutorily-guaranteed benefit .
1010	*VERRI:	Because in Lee , had the employer gotten the exemption from providing
1011		Social Security , the consequence would have been that the employees
1012		would have been disqualified from receiving Social Security benefits .
1013	*SCAL:	But that wasn't the basis for (.) for denying the claim .
1014	*SCAL:	The basis was that the government has to run a uniform system that
1015		applies to everybody .
1016	*VERRI:	I disagree .
1017	*SCAL:	And you can't argue that here because the government has made a lot of
1018		exemptions .
1019	*VERRI:	I (.) first of all , I disagree with respect to Lee , that one of the
1020		points that the Court made in Lee was that granting the exemption from
1021		Social Security taxes to an employer operates to impose the employer's
1022		religious faith on the employees .
1023	*VERRI:	It was one of the grounds of decision .
1024	@G:	---
1025	*VERRI:	Now (.) but turning to (.) I would like to address these exemptions .
1026	*VERRI:	I'm happy to talk about them .
1027	@G:	---
1028	*VERRI:	I'm happy to talk about our compelling interest at length .
1029	*VERRI:	The (.) now , the (.) my +/.
1030	*ALIT:	Well , if you could start with the question of whether the (.) the
1031		companies in this case have a right to bring <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] claims
1032		because they're for-profit corporations .
1033	*ALIT:	You argue that they can't .
1034	*VERRI:	+, That's correct .
1035	*ALIT:	Now , why is that ?
1036	*ALIT:	Is it (.) is it your position that there's something about the
1037		corporate form per se that is inconsistent with the free exercise
1038		claim ?
1039	*VERRI:	No , because , obviously , churches can bring claims .
1040	*ALIT:	All right .
1041	*ALIT:	But is it your argument that there's something about engaging in a
1042		for-profit activity that is inconsistent with a free exercise claim ?
1043	*VERRI:	Yes .
1044	*VERRI:	And if I could walk through the (.) let me , if you don't mind , just
1045		walk through the analysis on +/.
1046	*ALIT:	Well , were the merchants in the Braunfeld case engaged in for-profit
1047		activity ?
1048	*VERRI:	+, Yes .
1049	*ALIT:	So there isn't anything inherent in +/.
1050	*VERRI:	But I think +/.
1051	*ALIT:	+, in participating in a for-profit activity that's inconsistent with
1052		corporate form , is there ?
1053	*ALIT:	I'm sorry , with a free exercise claim .
1054	*VERRI:	+, Yes .
1055	*VERRI:	But I think the relevant question is what did Congress think it was
1056		doing when it enacted <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] in <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] ?
1057	*VERRI:	What kinds of claims did it think it was +/.
1058	*ALIT:	Well , what is it about +/.
1059	*VERRI:	+, justifying ?
1060	*ALIT:	+, a for-profit corporation that is inconsistent with a free exercise
1061		claim ?
1062	*ALIT:	Do you agree with the proposition that was endorsed by one of the lower
1063		courts in this case , that for-profit corporations must do nothing but
1064		maximize profits , they cannot have other aims +/.
1065	*VERRI:	No , not +/.
1066	*ALIT:	+, including religious aims ?
1067	*VERRI:	+, No .
1068	*VERRI:	But here's how we look at it .
1069	*VERRI:	At its core +/.
1070	*SOTO:	I'm sorry , General .
1071	*SOTO:	You answered yes to Braunfeld .
1072	*SOTO:	It was Jewish merchants , but it was the merchants themselves +/.
1073	*VERRI:	+, Individuals .
1074	*SOTO:	+, the individuals +/.
1075	*VERRI:	Yes .
1076	*SOTO:	+, not the corporation that was going to be jailed .
1077	*SOTO:	It was a +/.
1078	*VERRI:	Yes , that's right .
1079	*SOTO:	+, criminal prosecution .
1080	*VERRI:	I understood Justice Alito to be asking me not about the corporate
1081		form , but about the (.) the activity .
1082	*VERRI:	And when you have an individual , you have an individual .
1083	*VERRI:	It's a person .
1084	*SOTO:	So whether it was a merchant that was a corporation or not was
1085		irrelevant .
1086	@G:	---
1087	*SOTO:	It was that the individual was +/.
1088	*VERRI:	That's +/.
1089	*SOTO:	+, going to be jailed .
1090	*VERRI:	+, That's correct .
1091	*SCAL:	It was an individual making a profit , right ?
1092	*VERRI:	Certainly .
1093	*SCAL:	He was running a business for a profit , and that was the point of (.)
1094		of Justice Alito's question , right , which I think you understood .
1095	*VERRI:	And I did try to answer it , yes .
1096	*VERRI:	But I (.) but let me say , I think the relevant question here is what
1097		did Congress think it was doing in <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] ?
1098	*VERRI:	And I think the answer to that has to be in (.) you know , we
1099		understand the Dictionary Act provides a broad definition of person ,
1100		but the Dictionary Act doesn't define exercise religion .
1101	*VERRI:	And the operative statutory language is exercise (.) person's exercise
1102		of religion .
1103	*VERRI:	And so you can't look to the Dictionary Act to define that .
1104	*VERRI:	But Congress told you where to look .
1105	@G:	---
1106	*VERRI:	It told you to look to the pre-Smith case law +/.
1107	*ALIT:	And why did it tell +/.
1108	*VERRI:	+, to define that .
1109	*ALIT:	+, Why did it say that ?
1110	*ALIT:	It changed the definition at the time when <R_L_U_I_P_A> [= RLUIPA] was
1111		adopted , did it not , to eliminate the reference to the First
1112		Amendment ; isn't that right ?
1113	*VERRI:	Yes .
1114	*VERRI:	But it (.) but the difference there was to say it didn't want courts to
1115		get involved in the entangling enterprise of deciding what was a
1116		central belief versus what was +/.
1117	*ALIT:	Well , it says free exercise .
1118	@G:	---
1119	*ALIT:	And didn't it also adopt a provision in <R_L_U_I_P_A> [= RLUIPA] saying
1120		that (.) that the exercise of religion was to be interpreted in the
1121		broadest possible way ?
1122	*VERRI:	+, Well , I think it (.) it said something more precise than that ,
1123		which was that it was to be interpreted not to be confined only to
1124		central religious tenets .
1125	*ALIT:	No .
1126	*ALIT:	Didn't it say (.) didn't it say the term “ religious exercise ”
1127		includes any exercise +/.
1128	*VERRI:	Yes , includes any exercise of religion , but it doesn't define what
1129		that is .
1130	*VERRI:	It just says you don't draw a line between centrality and something
1131		that may +/.
1132	*ALIT:	+, No .
1133	*ALIT:	But there is another provision that says that , +"/.
1134	*ALIT:	+" This chapter shall be construed in favor of a broad protection of
1135		religious exercise to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this
1136		chapter and the Constitution .
1137	*VERRI:	+, Right .
1138	*VERRI:	And it (.) but with respect to what exercise religion means , it said
1139		don't draw lines between centrality and non-centrality .
1140	@G:	---
1141	*VERRI:	It didn't go beyond that and tell you what it means .
1142	@G:	---
1143	*VERRI:	And what <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] tells you to look to is pre-Smith case
1144		law .
1145	*VERRI:	And in the entire history of this country , there is not a single case
1146		in which a for-profit corporation was granted an exemption on +/.
1147	*SCAL:	Not a single case in which it was denied exemption , either .
1148	*SCAL:	All you're saying is +/.
1149	*VERRI:	+, Well , Lee +/.
1150	*SCAL:	+, that there are no cases .
1151	*VERRI:	+, Well , Lee was certainly a case in which a for-profit enterprise was
1152		denied an exemption .
1153	*VERRI:	Braunfeld was such a case .
1154	*VERRI:	Gallagher was such a case .
1155	*SCAL:	Not on the ground that it was a for-profit enterprise .
1156	*SCAL:	There is not a single case which says that a for-profit enterprise
1157		cannot make a (.) a freedom of religion claim , is there ?
1158	*VERRI:	Right .
1159	*VERRI:	There is not a single case +/.
1160	*SCAL:	Right .
1161	*VERRI:	+, holding that .
1162	*VERRI:	Except that in Lee , it was critical to the Court's analysis that the
1163		(.) that the (.) that <Mister> [= Mr.] Lee and his business had chosen
1164		to enter the commercial sphere .
1165	*KAGA:	Isn't that a merits question , General ?
1166	*KAGA:	I mean , I totally understand that argument as a (.) as an argument
1167		about the merits .
1168	*KAGA:	I'm not sure I understand it as a threshold claim that this (.) that
1169		the claim is not recognizable at all .
1170	*VERRI:	Right .
1171	*VERRI:	Well , let me (.) I do want to move to the compelling interest
1172		analysis , but if I could make one point in response to Your Honor's
1173		question , that the Court's got to decide what person (.) a person's
1174		exercise of religion means .
1175	*VERRI:	And that (.) it seems to me that it would be such a vast expansion of
1176		what Congress must (.) could have thought it was doing in <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] , when it enacted <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , to say that for-profit
1177		corporations can make claims for religious exemptions to any laws of
1178		general application that they want to challenge .
1179	@G:	---
1180	*VERRI:	I do (.) you know , <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement says , well , you don't
1181		have to worry about anything other than small , tightly-knit
1182		corporations like the one at issue here .
1183	*VERRI:	I take the point of the appeal of a situation like this one .
1184	*VERRI:	But the way in which he suggests that you will be able to distinguish
1185		this case from a case in which a large corporation comes in or a public
1186		company comes in , is that you will have more grounds to question the
1187		sincerity of the claim .
1188	*VERRI:	But that raises exactly the kinds of entanglement concerns that this
1189		Court has always said you should try to avoid .
1190	*ROBE:	Well , that's his argument for distinguishing it .
1191	*ROBE:	But there are others , including the fact that it is more you avoid all
1192		of the problems with what to do if it's a (.) you know , there's a
1193		<fifty-one> [= 51] percent ownership of the shareholders , if you simply say
1194		that it's in this type of Chapter S Corporation that is closely held .
1195	*ROBE:	Whether it applies in the other situations is (.) is a question that
1196		we'll have to await another case when a large publicly-traded
1197		corporation comes in and says , we have religious principles , the sort
1198		of situation , I don't think , is going to happen .
1199	*VERRI:	But even with respect to these companies , Your Honor , what are you
1200		going to do if there's a dispute between (.) let's say there are three
1201		shareholders (.) a dispute between two in the majority and one in the
1202		minority ?
1203	*VERRI:	You're going to have to get yourself involved (.) the courts will have
1204		to get themselves involved in all kinds of +/.
1205	*SCAL:	Whoever controls the corporation .
1206	*SCAL:	Whoever controls the corporation determines what the party +/.
1207	*VERRI:	+, And then (.) and the minority shareholder will say , well , this is
1208		(.) under state law , this is an act of oppression and this is +/.
1209	*ROBE:	Well , that's a question of State corporate law .
1210	*ROBE:	It's not a question of who can bring an action under <R_F_R_A> [=
1211		RFRA] .
1212	@G:	---
1213	*ROBE:	Could I just raise (.) eight courts of appeals , every court of appeal
1214		to have looked at the situation have held that corporations can bring
1215		racial discrimination claims as corporations .
1216	@G:	---
1217	*ROBE:	Now , does the government have a position on whether corporations have
1218		a race ?
1219	*VERRI:	+, Yes .
1220	*VERRI:	We think those are correct and that this situation is different .
1221	*ROBE:	So that (.) so that a corporation does have a race for purposes of
1222		discrimination laws .
1223	*VERRI:	No , not that the corporation has a race , but that corporations can
1224		bring those claims .
1225	*VERRI:	But you're not interpreting (.) in that situation , all you're
1226		interpreting is the word “ person ” +/.
1227	@G:	---
1228	*VERRI:	in a statute , not exercise of religion , which is what makes it
1229		different here .
1230	*ROBE:	So those (.) those cases involve construction of the term “ person ” ?
1231	*VERRI:	Yes , but only “ person ” .
1232	*ROBE:	So the person (.) the corporation can bring as a person a claim of
1233		racial discrimination .
1234	*VERRI:	That's correct , but not exercise of religion .
1235	*VERRI:	That's the difference .
1236	*VERRI:	But let me , if I could , we think that part of the problem here and
1237		the reason we make the argument we do at the threshold about why you
1238		ought not recognize claims under <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] for for-profit
1239		corporations is that they are going to predictively give rise to the
1240		kinds of issues you have in this case in which the exemption is going
1241		to impose a burden on third parties or extinguish rights of third
1242		parties , employees or others , and that that (.) that really can't be
1243		what Congress was thinking about .
1244	@G:	---
1245	*VERRI:	But even if you +/.
1246	*ALIT:	If you say they can't even get their (.) they can't even get their (.)
1247		their day in court , you're saying something pretty , pretty strong .
1248	*VERRI:	+, And I understand , but if Your Honor disagrees with me (.) if the
1249		Court doesn't agree with this position at the threshold , the same
1250		considerations with respect to the harms of third parties definitely
1251		play into the compelling-interest analysis .
1252	@G:	---
1253	*VERRI:	In fact , under <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] , the standard , the precise
1254		standard of the statute says the government must meet is that it must
1255		show that the application of the law to the particular parties here ,
1256		Conestoga and Hobby Lobby , is in furtherance of the government's
1257		compelling interest .
1258	*VERRI:	That's the test .
1259	*VERRI:	So the question here is whether having Hobby Lobby and Conestoga
1260		provide this coverage is in furtherance of the government's interests
1261		in ensuring that this kind of preventive service coverage is available
1262		and , in particular , the contraceptive coverage that's included within
1263		it .
1264	*KENN:	Is it your position that part of the compelling interest here is that
1265		you have to protect the integrity (.) the operational integrity of the
1266		whole Act ?
1267	*VERRI:	It is part of our argument , absolutely .
1268	*VERRI:	And (.) but it (.) but there is in addition to that , much more +/.
1269	*KENN:	Does that mean the constitutionality of the whole Act has to be
1270		examined before we accept your view ?
1271	*VERRI:	+, Well , I think it has been examined , Your Honor , is my
1272		recollection .
1273	@G:	---
1274	*VERRI:	0 &=laughter .
1275	*VERRI:	But (.) but with respect to (.) but with respect to the (.) there is a
1276		particularized interest here in that what we are talking about is a
1277		question of whether <fourteen thousand> [= 14,000] employees and their
1278		families get access to this contraceptive coverage .
1279	*KENN:	You (.) you have exempted a whole class of corporations and you've done
1280		so under your view not because of <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
1281	*VERRI:	So let me (.) let me go to that +/.
1282	*KENN:	Now , what (.) what kind of constitutional structure do we have if the
1283		Congress can give an agency the power to grant or not grant a religious
1284		exemption based on what the agency determined ?
1285	@G:	---
1286	*KENN:	I recognize delegation of powers rules are somewhat more abundant
1287		insofar as their enforcement in this Court .
1288	@G:	---
1289	*KENN:	But when we have a First Amendment issue of (.) of this consequence ,
1290		shouldn't we indicate that it's for the Congress , not the agency to
1291		determine that this corporation gets the exemption on that one , and
1292		not even for <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] purposes , for other purposes .
1293	*VERRI:	+, And , Your Honor , I do think that it was appropriate for the
1294		agency , in exercising its delegated authority here , to take into
1295		account the special solicitude that under our constitutional order
1296		churches receive .
1297	*VERRI:	And it's important to understand , and I want to walk through the (.)
1298		this question of exemptions very carefully because I think there's a
1299		lot of confusion here that needs to be cleared up , that all that the
1300		(.) all that the government has done is say that churches , because of
1301		that special solicitude , which the Court recognized in Hosanna-Tabor ,
1302		churches get an exemption .
1303	@G:	---
1304	*VERRI:	The nonprofit religious organizations don't get an exemption .
1305	*VERRI:	There's an accommodation there provided , but that accommodation
1306		results in the employees receiving access to this (.) to the
1307		contraceptive coverage , so that doesn't diminish the government's
1308		compelling interest .
1309	@G:	---
1310	*VERRI:	The Tenth Circuit and my friends on the other side have relied on this
1311		idea that employers with fewer than <fifty> [= 50] employees are somehow
1312		exempt .
1313	*KENN:	But you gave this exemption , according to your brief , without
1314		reference to the policies of <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
1315	*KENN:	What (.) what were the policies that you were implementing ?
1316	*VERRI:	Well , with respect to (.) as I said , with respect to the churches ,
1317		it was the special solicitude that churches receive under our
1318		Constitution under the First Amendment .
1319	@G:	---
1320	*VERRI:	But with respect (.) now with respect to the employers <fifty> [= 50]
1321		and under , it's just not right to say that there's any kind of an
1322		exemption .
1323	*VERRI:	If they offer health insurance , they're subject to exactly the same
1324		per-employee , per-day penalty as larger corporations , exactly the
1325		same risk of Labor Department enforcement , exactly the same risk of an
1326		<E_R_I_S_A> [= ERISA] suit by the plan beneficiaries .
1327	*VERRI:	There is no possible way to look at the statutory scheme and conclude
1328		there is an exemption there .
1329	*ROBE:	What about the grandfathered plans ?
1330	*VERRI:	Yes .
1331	*VERRI:	Let me talk about the grandfathered plans .
1332	*ROBE:	Well , just before you (.) so one thing I'd like you to address , the
1333		dispute arose with <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement about how long they were
1334		going to be in effect .
1335	*ROBE:	Can you make a representation to us about how long the grandfathering
1336		is going to be in effect ?
1337	*VERRI:	I (.) I can't give you a precise figure as to (.) there's a clear
1338		downward trajectory .
1339	*VERRI:	There's significant movement downward every year in the numbers .
1340	*VERRI:	There's every reason to think that's going to continue .
1341	*VERRI:	I can't give you a precise time when that is going to be +/.
1342	*ROBE:	Can you give me an approximate time , if not a precise one ?
1343	*VERRI:	+, I (.) I can't give you a representation of exactly how low that
1344		number is going to go and exactly how long it's going to take .
1345	*VERRI:	But I think what you're talking about is a period in which that number
1346		is going to go to a very , very low level over a several year period .
1347	*ROBE:	Well , if you can't tell us , and I don't fault you for not being able
1348		to tell us , when the grandfathering is going to end , shouldn't we
1349		assume in our analysis that it is current and , as far as we can tell ,
1350		not going to end ?
1351	*VERRI:	No .
1352	*VERRI:	I don't that's right , Your Honor .
1353	*VERRI:	And I think (.) let's (.) let's look at this , if we could , in toto .
1354	*VERRI:	That with respect to grandfathering , it's to be expected that
1355		employers and insurance companies are going to make decisions that
1356		trigger the loss of that so-called grandfathered status under the (.)
1357		under the governing regulation .
1358	*ALIT:	Isn't it true with respect to the grandfathered plans that the
1359		regulations required immediate compliance with certain requirements ,
1360		but not with preventive care requirements ; isn't that right ?
1361	@G:	---
1362	*ALIT:	Let me read you what <H_H_S> [= HHS] said in the regulation : +"/.
1363	*ALIT:	+" With certain particularly significant protections , particularly
1364		significant protections , Congress required grandfathered health plans
1365		to comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act's health reform
1366		provisions .
1367	*ALIT:	+" On the other hand , grandfathered health plans are not required to
1368		comply with certain other requirements of the Affordable Care Act ; for
1369		example , the requirement that preventive health services be covered
1370		without any cost sharing .
1371	@G:	---
1372	*ALIT:	So isn't <H_H_S> [= HHS] saying there , quite specifically , these , in
1373		our view , are not within this subset of particularly significant
1374		requirements as to which there must be immediate compliance ?
1375	*VERRI:	Well , the (.) the question would be whether there's a compelling
1376		interest in compliance with these requirements .
1377	*VERRI:	And I (.) I'd like to make two points in response to Your Honor's
1378		question .
1379	@G:	---
1380	*VERRI:	First with respect to this issue of delay , which I think , <Mister> [=
1381		Mr.] Chief Justice , your question raised , and my friend on the other
1382		side has put a lot of weight on , I'd refer the Court to the <A_D_A> [=
1383		ADA] .
1384	*VERRI:	I don't think anybody would doubt that the Americans with Disabilities
1385		Act advances interest of the highest order .
1386	*VERRI:	But when Congress enacted that , it put a two-year delay on the
1387		applicability of the discrimination provision .
1388	*ROBE:	Well , isn't that because you're talking about building ramps and
1389		things like that ?
1390	*VERRI:	No .
1391	*VERRI:	No , Your Honor .
1392	@G:	---
1393	*VERRI:	There's an even longer delay with respect to those kinds of
1394		provisions , but it's just a basic prohibition of discrimination
1395		two-year delay , and no one would doubt there's a compelling interest
1396		here .
1397	*VERRI:	And with (.) and take (.) take Title <V_I_I> [= VII] .
1398	*VERRI:	My friends on the other side have said , well , this is different
1399		because there's so many more people who are going to not have this
1400		coverage under the grandfathered plan .
1401	*VERRI:	But with respect to Title <V_I_I> [= VII] , of course , it's still the
1402		case that (.) that employers with <fifteen> [= 15] or fewer people are not
1403		subject to that law , and that's <eighty> [= 80] percent of the employers
1404		in the country .
1405	*VERRI:	And if you run the math , that's (.) it's at least <eighty> [= 80]
1406		percent (.) that's (.) it's going to be somewhere between <ten> [= 10]
1407		and <twenty-two> [= 22] million people who are not within the coverage .
1408	*VERRI:	No one would say that because the coverage is incomplete in that
1409		respect , that Title <V_I_I> [= VII] (.) enforcing Title <V_I_I> [=
1410		VII] doesn't advance +/.
1411	*ROBE:	Those were decisions (.) those were decisions that Congress made ,
1412		right ?
1413	*VERRI:	+, Yes .
1414	*ROBE:	Well , the grandfathering is not a decision that Congress made , is
1415		it ?
1416	*VERRI:	Well , the way in which it's implemented is a decision that the agency
1417		has made , that's true .
1418	*VERRI:	But even with respect to the preventive services , I don't think anyone
1419		would say that there's not a compelling interest in advancing
1420		colorectal cancer screening and immunizations and the things that the
1421		preventive services provisions provide in addition to contraceptive
1422		coverage .
1423	*VERRI:	I just think this is a compelling interest under any understanding of
1424		the term .
1425	*BREY:	I just want (.) before you get to this point , and my question reflects
1426		no point of view at all on my behalf .
1427	*BREY:	I just (.) but I took <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , one of his points ,
1428		which I thought was an important one .
1429	*BREY:	He says there are some people here who strongly object to helping with
1430		abortions which include abortifacient contraceptives .
1431	*BREY:	Everybody says , yes , they do object to that and that's sincere .
1432	*BREY:	So he's not saying this , but I might .
1433	@G:	---
1434	*BREY:	But there is a compelling interest in women's health and in the health
1435		of the family , and they're not having a religious objection to taking
1436		it .
1437	@G:	---
1438	*BREY:	And so the government has said provide it .
1439	@G:	---
1440	*BREY:	Then he says , but there is a less restrictive way , and the less
1441		restrictive way is the government pays for it .
1442	*BREY:	Says it wouldn't cost much .
1443	@G:	---
1444	*BREY:	You'd have to have another piece of paper that would go to the
1445		insurance company that would say , insofar as your employer has a
1446		sincere objection against paying this , the government will pay for
1447		it .
1448	@G:	---
1449	*BREY:	Now , what I want to hear , and this is not coming from any point of
1450		view , I want to hear your precise answer to that kind of argument .
1451	*VERRI:	Yes .
1452	*VERRI:	They did argue (.) I will point out , for the first time at the podium
1453		this morning (.) that a less restrictive means would be to extend the
1454		accommodation that currently exists +/.
1455	*BREY:	I'm not interested in whether they made the argument sooner or later .
1456	*BREY:	What I want to hear from you is I want to hear (.) and it's not (.)
1457		you've thought about this .
1458	*BREY:	I want to hear your answer to that kind of argument .
1459	*VERRI:	+, Well +/.
1460	*BREY:	I want to be sure you have a chance to give it .
1461	*VERRI:	+, The answer (.) I think there are two answers to it .
1462	*VERRI:	Assuming it's before the Court (.) and I'm going to answer your honest
1463		question directly , but I do want to make a prefatory point here ,
1464		which is that under the law , under Ashcroft <v@l> [= v.] <A_C_L_U> [=
1465		ACLU] , for example , the burden on the government is to show that
1466		proposed less restrictive alternatives are not equally effective .
1467	*VERRI:	If they don't propose it , we don't have a burden to refute it .
1468	@G:	---
1469	*VERRI:	Having said that , we can refute it .
1470	*VERRI:	Now , there are two (.) and there are two ways .
1471	*VERRI:	The first is , they claim that they don't think that the accommodation
1472		is a less restrictive means , I take it , because (.) or they haven't
1473		raised it before today , because they believe that <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA]
1474		would require exemptions to that too , such that if you were (.) if you
1475		were to provide the accommodation in which the insurance company comes
1476		in and provides the contraception if the employer signs the form , they
1477		would say that that (.) signing the form also makes them complicit in
1478		the central activity , and that therefore <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] provides
1479		an exemption there , too .
1480	@G:	---
1481	*VERRI:	And of course the test is whether the proposed alternative advances the
1482		government's interests as effectively .
1483	*VERRI:	And if it is going to be subject to exactly the same <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA]
1484		objections by exactly the same class of people asking for it , it's not
1485		going to serve the government's interest as effectively because the
1486		<R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] exemption will result in no coverage there .
1487	@G:	---
1488	*VERRI:	The second point being that +/.
1489	*SCAL:	+, So don't make them sign a piece of paper .
1490	*VERRI:	+, Well , whether they sign the piece of paper or not , if they make
1491		the <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] claim there , which they have with respect to
1492		that accommodation , it will result in it being less effective in terms
1493		of accomplishing the compelling interest .
1494	*VERRI:	In addition +/.
1495	*ALIT:	Well , we can ask <Mister> [= Mr.] Clement what his position is on
1496		this .
1497	*ALIT:	But you say they have already asserted that it would be inconsistent
1498		with <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] as they understand it to provide for a
1499		for-profit corporation , like the ones involved here , the sort of
1500		accommodation that <H_H_S> [= HHS] has extended to so-called religious
1501		nonprofits , perhaps with the modification that was included in our
1502		stay order in the Little Sisters case .
1503	*ALIT:	Have they taken a position on that ?
1504	*VERRI:	+, You'll have to ask them .
1505	@G:	---
1506	*VERRI:	I don't think they have .
1507	*VERRI:	But they have studiously avoided arguing this as a less restrictive
1508		alternative , and I take it it's because their theory , at least ,
1509		would lead one to the conclusion you would have to provide a <R_F_R_A>
1510		[= RFRA] objection .
1511	*VERRI:	But now the (.) yes , thank you , <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice .
1512	@G:	---
1513	*VERRI:	The second point is that you're talking about a very open-ended
1514		increase in the cost to the government .
1515	*VERRI:	Now , we don't know how much that cost would be .
1516	*VERRI:	The reason is because , since this wasn't litigated in the lower
1517		courts , there's not a record on it .
1518	*VERRI:	So I can't tell you what that (.) what that increased cost is going to
1519		be , but it could be quite considerable .
1520	*SCAL:	You're talking about , what , three or four birth controls , not all of
1521		them , just those that are abortifacient .
1522	*SCAL:	That's not terribly expensive stuff , is it ?
1523	*VERRI:	Well , to the contrary .
1524	@G:	---
1525	*VERRI:	And two points to make about that .
1526	*VERRI:	First , of course the (.) one of the methods of contraception they
1527		object to here is the <I_U_D> [= IUD] .
1528	*VERRI:	And that is by far and away the method of contraception that is most
1529		effective , but has the highest upfront cost and creates precisely the
1530		kind of cost barrier that the preventive services provision is trying
1531		to break down .
1532	*ALIT:	I thought that (.) I was taken by your answer .
1533	*ALIT:	I thought it was the government's position that providing coverage for
1534		the full range of contraceptives and other devices and drugs that are
1535		covered here is actually financially neutral for an insurance company ,
1536		that that reduces other costs that they would incur .
1537	*VERRI:	It is for the insurance company , but for the woman who is going to not
1538		get the benefit of the statute if the exemption is granted +/.
1539	*ALIT:	No .
1540	*ALIT:	No .
1541	*ALIT:	If she (.) if she has the coverage through the insurance company but
1542		the employer has nothing to do with arranging for that .
1543	*VERRI:	+, Well , so , in other words , if they haven't raised a <R_F_R_A> [=
1544		RFRA] objection to the alternative , but that (.) but as I said , you
1545		know , the logic of their position is that you would get a <R_F_R_A> [=
1546		RFRA] objection .
1547	*VERRI:	It can't be +/.
1548	*BREY:	Still , I want to get (.) press this a little further , and I don't
1549		want you simply to just agree with what I'm about to say .
1550	*VERRI:	+, Don't worry .
1551	@G:	---
1552	*VERRI:	0 &=laughter .
1553	*BREY:	No , I mean (.) I mean , after all , somebody , a taxpayer , might
1554		say , +"/.
1555	*BREY:	+" I don't want to pay for this small war .
1556	*BREY:	And it would be a religious ground , and it would be very , very little
1557		money , in fact , that you take from him .
1558	*BREY:	Or the church might say , +"/.
1559	*BREY:	+" I want a Sunday morning reduction in the cost of municipal parking .
1560	*BREY:	And by the way , that will not only not cost the government anything ,
1561		they'll make money because nobody parks there on Sunday , particularly
1562		with this high a fee .
1563	@G:	---
1564	*BREY:	Now , I'm thinking of (.) I'm trying to figure out where this case fits
1565		in that spectrum because I think the answer to the first two questions
1566		is no .
1567	*BREY:	And I know , so you're just going to agree , and that's what I don't
1568		want .
1569	*BREY:	I want to understand your thinking on that .
1570	*VERRI:	On that point , I think that question plugs into our view of what the
1571		substantial burden test requires , that their view of substantial
1572		burden is if you have a sincere religious belief and there is any law
1573		with a meaningful penalty that imposes on you pressure to do something
1574		inconsistent with your belief , then you may pass the substantial
1575		burden test .
1576	@G:	---
1577	*VERRI:	I think the problem with that test as they formulate it , is that under
1578		the two hypotheticals that you just gave , Justice Breyer , you've got
1579		a substantial burden in those situations , because if you don't pay the
1580		tax you can go to jail , for example .
1581	@G:	---
1582	*VERRI:	And so we think the substantial burden analysis has got to be more
1583		strenuous than that .
1584	*VERRI:	It's got to incorporate principles of attenuation and proximate cause ,
1585		and that when you think about this case where the requirement is to
1586		purchase insurance which enables actions by others , that you're really
1587		closer to the tax situation than to imposing a direct obligation to
1588		act .
1589	@G:	---
1590	*VERRI:	So that's how we would think about that issue .
1591	*VERRI:	But now , with respect to +/.
1592	*ALIT:	<Mister> [= Mr.] (.) General Verrilli , isn't that really a question of
1593		theology or moral philosophy , which has been debated for (.) by many
1594		scholars and adherents to many religions .
1595	*ALIT:	A does something that B thinks is immoral .
1596	*ALIT:	How close a connection does there have to be between what B does that
1597		may have some (.) that may provide some assistance to A in order for B
1598		to (.) to be required to refrain from doing that (.) that action .
1599	*VERRI:	+, It's true that it's a difficult question .
1600	*VERRI:	But it isn't +/.
1601	*ALIT:	It is a religious question and it's a moral question .
1602	*ALIT:	And you want us to provide a definitive secular answer to it ?
1603	*VERRI:	+, No , but I do think the problem , Justice Alito , is that this Court
1604		has recognized , and certainly the courts of appeals have recognized ,
1605		that there is a difference .
1606	*VERRI:	You accept the sincerity of the belief , but the Court still has to
1607		make a judgment of its own about what constitutes a substantial
1608		burden , or otherwise , for example , the tax thing would be a
1609		substantial burden .
1610	*VERRI:	Or we cited a <D_C> [= D.C.] +/.
1611	@G:	---
1612	*VERRI:	Circuit case in which prisoners objected to giving <D_N_A> [= DNA]
1613		samples and the court said : We accept the sincerity of that belief ,
1614		but it's up to us to decide whether that's a actually substantial
1615		burden .
1616	@G:	---
1617	*VERRI:	In the Bowen case in this Court , the Court accepted the sincerity of
1618		the belief that the use of the child's Social Security number would
1619		offend religious belief and commitments , but said they still had to
1620		make a judgment about whether that was a substantial burden .
1621	@G:	---
1622	*VERRI:	So it does have to be , with all due respect , part of the analysis .
1623	*KENN:	I still don't understand how <H_H_S> [= HHS] exercised its judgment to
1624		grant the exemption to nonreligious corporations if you say it was not
1625		compelled by <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
1626	*VERRI:	I don't think +/.
1627	*KENN:	Then it must have been because the health care coverage was not that
1628		important .
1629	*VERRI:	+, It didn't grant an exemption to any nonreligious organizations ,
1630		Justice Kennedy .
1631	*VERRI:	It granted an exemption to churches , and that was it .
1632	*VERRI:	With respect to religious nonprofits , it constructed an
1633		accommodation , but the accommodation delivers the contraceptive
1634		coverage to the employees of the nonprofits .
1635	*VERRI:	It just does it through an indirect means .
1636	*VERRI:	But there is no diminution of the (.) there's no basis for questioning
1637		the government's interest with respect to that accommodation because
1638		the employees get the coverage , just as they would +/.
1639	*ROBE:	Well , but that of course is an issue that's being hotly litigated
1640		right now , right ?
1641	*ROBE:	Whether the employees can get the coverage when you're talking about
1642		the religious organizations .
1643	*VERRI:	+, Well , that's exactly why I think you can't look to that as a less
1644		restrictive (.) that accommodation , extending that accommodation to
1645		for-profit corporations .
1646	*VERRI:	As a less restrictive alternative .
1647	*VERRI:	Precisely because it's being hotly litigated whether <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA]
1648		will require exemptions to that , as well .
1649	*ROBE:	But you're relying (.) you're relying on it to make your point with
1650		respect to the accommodation , and then you're criticizing your friend
1651		for relying on the same thing in making his points .
1652	*VERRI:	Well , I think (.) I think what Justice Kennedy (.) I took Justice
1653		Kennedy to be asking me , <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice , was whether
1654		the government's choice to provide that accommodation reflected a
1655		judgment on the part of the government that this was something less
1656		than a compelling interest , and I don't think that inference is
1657		possible , because the government was trying to use that accommodation
1658		to ensure that the contraceptives were delivered .
1659	*VERRI:	So , with all due respect , I don't think there is an inconsistency
1660		there .
1661	@G:	---
1662	*VERRI:	And I (.) and I do think , if I could , with respect to this issue of
1663		whether there are exemptions that defeat a compelling interest , that I
1664		submit would be a very dangerous principle for this Court to adopt in
1665		the form that my friends on the other side have offered it , because
1666		not only would you then be in a position where it would be very hard to
1667		see how Title <V_I_I> [= VII] enforcement could be justified by
1668		compelling interest in response to a <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] objection ,
1669		<A_D_A> [= ADA] enforcement , <F_M_L_A> [= FMLA] enforcement , all
1670		kinds of things .
1671	*VERRI:	And I do think +/.
1672	*GINS:	Title <V_I_I> [= VII] was passed before <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] , so it
1673		wouldn't apply (.) <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] wouldn't apply to Title <V_I_I>
1674		[= VII] .
1675	*VERRI:	+, Well , I think (.) with all due respect , Justice Ginsburg , I think
1676		you could claim a <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] exemption from Title <V_I_I> [=
1677		VII] .
1678	*VERRI:	And the problem here would be that (.) and I think one of the things
1679		that's significant about the position that my friends on the other side
1680		are taking here , is that with respect to exemptions , for example ,
1681		from the Title <V_I_I> [= VII] requirement against discrimination on
1682		the basis of religion and hiring , Congress made a quite clear judgment
1683		to provide a very narrow exemption : Churches and religious educational
1684		institutions and religious associations , and that's it .
1685	*VERRI:	Nobody else can claim an exemption under Title <V_I_I> [= VII] .
1686	*SCAL:	Except that they passed <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] after that .
1687	*SCAL:	That made a lot of sense .
1688	*SCAL:	But the question is they passed <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] after that .
1689	*VERRI:	But I think the further question , Your Honor , is whether you would
1690		interpret <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] in a manner where you would essentially
1691		obliterate that carefully crafted (.) or what Congress meant to do was
1692		to obliterate that carefully crafted exemption and instead say that
1693		every for-profit corporation could make a request like that .
1694	*ROBE:	Well , if Congress feels as strongly about this as you suggest , they
1695		can always pass an exemption , an exception to <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] ,
1696		which they have done on other occasions .
1697	*ROBE:	And they haven't done it here .
1698	*VERRI:	Well , with all due respect , Your Honor , I think you could make the
1699		same argument either way in this case , that the question here is what
1700		Congress thought it was doing in <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] , and we don't
1701		think , given the long history and the fact that not only do you have
1702		no case in which a for-profit corporation ever had a successful +/.
1703	*ROBE:	Well , we've already discussed that there is no case holding that they
1704		can't , right ?
1705	*VERRI:	+, In addition , if you look at the history of exemptions and
1706		accommodations in our legislation , State and Federal legislation may
1707		extend to churches and religious nonprofits , and that's (.) and
1708		individuals .
1709	*VERRI:	And that's where the line has been drawn in our legislation
1710		historically .
1711	*VERRI:	There just is nothing in our current +/.
1712	*KENN:	Under your view , a profit corporation could be forced (.) in
1713		principle , there are some statutes on the books now which would
1714		prevent it , but (.) could be forced in principle to pay for
1715		abortions .
1716	*VERRI:	+, No .
1717	*VERRI:	I think , as you said , the law now (.) the law now is to the
1718		contrary .
1719	*KENN:	But your reasoning would permit that .
1720	*VERRI:	Well , I think that (.) you know , I don't think that that's (.) I
1721		think it would depend on the law and it would depend on the entity .
1722	*VERRI:	It certainly wouldn't be true , I think , for religious nonprofits .
1723	*VERRI:	It certainly wouldn't be true for a church .
1724	*KENN:	I'm talking about a profit corporation .
1725	*KENN:	You say profit corporations just don't have any standing to vindicate
1726		the religious rights of their shareholders and owners .
1727	*VERRI:	Well , I think that if it were for a for-profit corporation and if such
1728		a law like that were enacted , then you're right , under our theory
1729		that the for-profit corporation wouldn't have an ability to sue .
1730	*VERRI:	But there is no law like that on the books .
1731	*VERRI:	In fact , the law is the opposite .
1732	*ROBE:	I'm sorry , I lost track of that .
1733	*ROBE:	There is no law on the books that does what ?
1734	*VERRI:	That makes a requirement of the kind that Justice Kennedy
1735		hypothesized .
1736	*VERRI:	The law is the opposite .
1737	*ROBE:	Well , flesh it out a little more .
1738	*ROBE:	What (.) there is no law on the books that does what ?
1739	*VERRI:	That requires for-profit corporations to provide abortions .
1740	*KENN:	What if a law like that +/.
1741	*ROBE:	Isn't that what we are talking about in terms of their religious
1742		beliefs ?
1743	@G:	---
1744	*ROBE:	One of the religious beliefs is that they have to pay for these four
1745		methods of contraception that they believe provide abortions .
1746	*ROBE:	I thought that's what we had before us .
1747	*VERRI:	It is their sincere belief and we don't question that .
1748	*VERRI:	But I will say , and I do think this is important and I say it with all
1749		respect , that that is how they (.) that is the judgment that they
1750		make .
1751	*VERRI:	It is not the judgment that Federal law or State law reflects .
1752	*VERRI:	Federal law and State law which does (.) which do preclude funding for
1753		abortions don't consider these particular forms of contraception to be
1754		abortion .
1755	@G:	---
1756	*VERRI:	With all due respect , I would say that I think that , you know , we've
1757		got about <two> [= 2] million women who rely on the <I_U_D> [= IUD] as
1758		a method of birth control in this country .
1759	*VERRI:	I don't think they think they are engaged in abortion in doing that .
1760	*VERRI:	It is their belief .
1761	*VERRI:	It's sincere .
1762	*VERRI:	We respect it .
1763	@G:	---
1764	*VERRI:	But it isn't a belief that we think is reflected in Federal or State
1765		law or our traditions of where that line is drawn .
1766	*VERRI:	And so (.) and I do think that that is what makes this a difficult
1767		case .
1768	*VERRI:	I agree .
1769	@G:	---
1770	*VERRI:	And if you disagree with our position at the threshold that
1771		corporations (.) that even though you have a situation , and we
1772		acknowledge you can have situations , in which a tightly knit group of
1773		(.) a small group of tightly knit individuals own and operate a
1774		corporation where there is appeal to that , to the argument that they
1775		ought to recognize a claim of exercising religion in those
1776		circumstances .
1777	@G:	---
1778	*VERRI:	The problem , I would submit , is with the implications of doing it ,
1779		the implications for entanglement and making the judgments when you
1780		move past that group , the administrability problems , and the problems
1781		of inviting the kinds of claims that are predictably going to impose
1782		harms on third parties .
1783	*ALIT:	What about the implications of saying that no for-profit corporation
1784		can raise any sort of free exercise claim at all and nobody associated
1785		with the for-profit corporation can raise any sort of free exercise
1786		claim at all ?
1787	@G:	---
1788	*ALIT:	Let me give you this example .
1789	*ALIT:	According to the media , Denmark recently prohibited kosher and halal
1790		slaughter methods because they believe that they are inhumane .
1791	*ALIT:	Now , suppose Congress enacted something like that here .
1792	*ALIT:	What would the (.) what would a corporation that is a kosher or halal
1793		slaughterhouse do ?
1794	*ALIT:	They would simply (.) they would have no recourse whatsoever .
1795	*ALIT:	They couldn't even get a day in court .
1796	*ALIT:	They couldn't raise a <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] claim .
1797	*ALIT:	They couldn't raise a First Amendment claim .
1798	*VERRI:	Well , I'm not sure they couldn't raise a First Amendment claim ,
1799		Justice Alito .
1800	@G:	---
1801	*VERRI:	I think if you had a targeted law like that , that targeted a specific
1802		religious practice , that (.) I don't think it is our position that
1803		they couldn't make a free exercise claim in that circumstance and
1804		so +/.
1805	*ALIT:	Why is that +/.
1806	*KENN:	+, Well , but you're getting away from the hypothetical .
1807	*KENN:	Say (.) Justice Alito's hypothetical was that the impetus for this was
1808		humane treatment of animals .
1809	*KENN:	There was no animus to religion at all , which in the Church of
1810		Lukumi , there was an animus to the religion .
1811	*KENN:	So we're taking that out of the hypothetical .
1812	*ALIT:	+, Exactly .
1813	*VERRI:	+, Right .
1814	*VERRI:	Well , I think if it were targeted only at the practices of the (.) the
1815		kosher and halal practices , then I think you would have an issue of
1816		whether it's a targeted law or not .
1817	*VERRI:	But even if it is +/.
1818	*ALIT:	Well , they say no animal may be slaughtered unless it's stunned
1819		first , unless the animal is rendered unconscious before it is
1820		slaughtered .
1821	*VERRI:	+, Well , I think in that circumstance , you would have , I think , an
1822		ability for customers to bring suit .
1823	*VERRI:	I think you might recognize third party standing on behalf of the
1824		corporation (.) on the corporations , on behalf of customers .
1825	*VERRI:	So a suit like that could be brought .
1826	@G:	---
1827	*VERRI:	But even if you disagree with me at the threshold , even if you
1828		disagree with us with respect to the kinds of risks that we think you
1829		will be inviting if you hold that for-profit corporations can bring
1830		these claims , when you get to the compelling interest analysis , the
1831		rights of the third party employees are at center stage here .
1832	*VERRI:	And that's (.) I think that's the point of critical importance in
1833		thinking about this case .
1834	*VERRI:	And I think , frankly , the point that has been just left on the
1835		sidelines by my friends on the other side .
1836	@G:	---
1837	*VERRI:	The consequence of holding here that the <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] exemption
1838		applies is not a situation like ones in which this Court under the Free
1839		Exercise Clause or under <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] have recognized exemptions
1840		in the past .
1841	*VERRI:	Those have always been situations where it's a relationship between the
1842		individual and the government and granting the exemption might result
1843		in the government not being able to enforce the law with respect to the
1844		individual , but +/.
1845	*BREY:	I mean , the point that Justice Alito was making is that (.) take five
1846		Jewish or Muslim butchers and what you're saying to them is if they
1847		choose to work under the corporate form , which is viewed universally ,
1848		you have to give up on that form the Freedom of Exercise Clause that
1849		you'd otherwise have .
1850	@G:	---
1851	*BREY:	Now , looked at that way , I don't think it matters whether they call
1852		themselves a corporation or whether they call themselves individuals .
1853	*BREY:	I mean , I think that's the question you're being asked , and I need to
1854		know what your response is to it .
1855	*VERRI:	+, Well , I think our response is what the Court said in Part <three> [= 3] of the Lee opinion , which is that once you make a choice to go into
1856		the commercial sphere , which you certainly do when you incorporate as
1857		a for-profit corporation , you are making a choice to live by the rules
1858		that govern you and your competitors in the commercial sphere .
1859	@G:	---
1860	*VERRI:	But even if you disagree with me about that , what I'd like to leave
1861		the Court with , is what I think is the most important point here , is
1862		that if this exemption were granted , it will be the first time under
1863		the Free Exercise Clause or under <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] in which this
1864		Court or any court has held that an employer may take (.) may be
1865		granted an exemption that extinguishes statutorily-guaranteed benefits
1866		of fundamental importance .
1867	@G:	---
1868	*VERRI:	Lee came to exactly the opposite conclusion with respect to Social
1869		Security benefits , that you (.) that it was imperative that the
1870		employee's interest be protected .
1871	*VERRI:	And that is the fundamental problem with the position that my friends
1872		on the other side raise here , that they leave the third-party
1873		employees entirely out of the equation .
1874	*SCAL:	That's okay for not-for-profit corporations to do that with respect to
1875		all of their employees , and some of them are pretty big operations +/.
1876	*VERRI:	No .
1877	*SCAL:	+, that's okay there ?
1878	*VERRI:	No , we don't think that .
1879	@G:	---
1880	*VERRI:	We don't (.) we're not drawing a line between non-profits and profits .
1881	*SCAL:	They can make (.) you allow them to make this religious objection ,
1882		don't you ?
1883	*VERRI:	No .
1884	*VERRI:	No .
1885	*VERRI:	Religious non-profits get an accommodation in which their employees get
1886		the contraception .
1887	*VERRI:	But we are not drawing a line between for-profit and profit .
1888	*SCAL:	But they don't have to pay for it , right ?
1889	*VERRI:	The +/.
1890	*SCAL:	And you could set that up this way , that these people don't have to
1891		pay for it .
1892	*VERRI:	+, Well , as I've said a couple of times , they haven't asked for that
1893		until this morning .
1894	*VERRI:	But the fundamental point here is that you would be extinguishing
1895		statutorily-guaranteed health benefits of fundamental importance to
1896		these employees , and that is something that this Court has never
1897		done .
1898	@G:	---
1899	*VERRI:	And I submit that Congress can't have thought it was authorizing it
1900		when it enacted <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] in <nineteen ninety-three> [= 1993] .
1901	@G:	---
1902	*VERRI:	Thank you .
1903	*ROBE:	Thank you , General .
1904	@G:	---
1905	*ROBE:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Clement , four minutes .
1906	@Comment:	REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT ON BEHALF OF PRIVATE
1907		PARTIES
1908	*CLEME:	Thank you , <Mister> [= Mr.] Chief Justice .
1909	@G:	---
1910	*CLEME:	Just a few points in rebuttal .
1911	*CLEME:	Let me start with the Abortion Conscious Clause .
1912	*CLEME:	It's (.) because it tells you something about where Congress has drawn
1913		the line and it tells you the consequences of the government's
1914		position .
1915	*CLEME:	Historically , those conscious provisions have applied to all medical
1916		providers , including for-profit medical providers .
1917	*CLEME:	But we learned today that as far as the government's concerned , that's
1918		just Congress' judgment .
1919	*CLEME:	If Congress changes its judgment and says that a for-profit medical
1920		provider has to provide an abortion , <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] doesn't
1921		apply .
1922	*CLEME:	That , with all due respect , cannot be what Congress had in mind when
1923		it passed <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
1924	*CLEME:	They also suggested if a kosher market takes the trouble to incorporate
1925		itself , then it has no free exercise claims at all .
1926	@G:	---
1927	*CLEME:	Now , you can go back and read the Crown kosher case .
1928	*CLEME:	I took it as common ground , that all nine justices thought that if the
1929		Massachusetts law there had forced Crown kosher to be open on
1930		Saturday , that that would be a free exercise claim notwithstanding the
1931		incorporation .
1932	@G:	---
1933	*CLEME:	The second point I want to talk about is the least restrictive
1934		alternatives .
1935	*CLEME:	In a colloquy with Justice Scalia , the Solicitor General points out
1936		that yeah , well , it's a little bit different from the pre-Smith law
1937		because now you have the less restrictive alternatives analysis .
1938	@G:	---
1939	*CLEME:	That's not a small difference .
1940	*CLEME:	That's a major difference .
1941	*CLEME:	And it's really the easiest way to rule against the government in this
1942		case .
1943	*CLEME:	Because you have a unique situation here where their policy is about a
1944		government (.) a subsidy for a government-preferred health care item ,
1945		and the question is who pays ?
1946	*CLEME:	The government paying or a third-party insurer paying is a perfectly
1947		good least restrictive alternative .
1948	*SOTO:	So we go back to the start of my question , that would be essentially
1949		the same for vaccines , blood transfusions , non-pork products , the
1950		government has to pay for all of the medical needs that an employer
1951		thinks or claims it has a religious exemption to ?
1952	*CLEME:	Not necessarily , Justice Sotomayor .
1953	*CLEME:	It will depend on how you +/.
1954	*SOTO:	Because those things are more important ?
1955	*CLEME:	+, No , not because they're more +/.
1956	*SOTO:	It's really the amount of money +/.
1957	*CLEME:	+, important .
1958	*CLEME:	But the easiest way to distinguish them is if the government's already
1959		provided this accommodation for religious employers .
1960	*SOTO:	+, Well , but they +/.
1961	*CLEME:	And with all due respect +/.
1962	*SOTO:	+, they make exemptions for vaccines , presumably , to some people on
1963		some basis , but we have a tax code that applies to everybody , but we
1964		have a million exemptions .
1965	@G:	---
1966	*SOTO:	Does the creation of the exemption relieve me from paying taxes when I
1967		have a sincere religious belief that taxes are immoral ?
1968	*CLEME:	+, I think Lee says that taxes are different and not all exemptions are
1969		created equal , because some exemptions undermine the compelling
1970		interest .
1971	*CLEME:	Now , the reason +/.
1972	*ALIT:	Isn't there a Federal program that pays for vaccines for any children
1973		who are not covered by insurance for those vaccines ?
1974	*CLEME:	+, There is , Justice Alito .
1975	*CLEME:	Of course , there's also Title X , which provides for contraception
1976		coverage , which is another least restrictive alternative .
1977	@G:	---
1978	*CLEME:	But I do want to get on the table that it is not true , that we have
1979		not suggested that the accommodation provided to religious employers ,
1980		like nonprofit hospitals , that's not something I invented at the
1981		podium .
1982	@G:	---
1983	*CLEME:	If you look at page <fifty-eight> [= 58] of our brief , the red brief , we
1984		specifically say that one of the least restrictive alternatives would
1985		be (.) the most obvious least restrictive alternative is for the
1986		government to pay for their favorite contraception methods themselves .
1987	@G:	---
1988	*CLEME:	Later in that paragraph , the only full paragraph on the page , we
1989		say , +"/.
1990	*CLEME:	+" And indeed , the government has attempted something like that with
1991		respect to certain objective employers (.) objective employees (.)
1992		employers .
1993	*CLEME:	and we cite the Federal Register provision where there is the
1994		accommodation provision .
1995	*SOTO:	Will your clients claim that filling out the form , if (.) you're
1996		saying they would claim an exemption like the churches have already ?
1997	*CLEME:	We haven't been offered that accommodation , so we haven't had to
1998		decide what kind of objection , if any , we would make to that .
1999	*CLEME:	But it's important to recognize that as I understand that litigation ,
2000		the objection is not to the fact that the insurance or the provider
2001		pays for the contraception coverage .
2002	*CLEME:	The whole debate is about how much complicity there has to be from the
2003		employer in order to trigger that coverage .
2004	*CLEME:	And whatever the answer is for Little Sisters of the Poor , presumably
2005		you can extend the same thing to my clients and there wouldn't be a
2006		problem with that .
2007	@G:	---
2008	*CLEME:	If I could have just one second more to say that the agency point that
2009		Justice Kennedy has pointed to is tremendously important , because
2010		Congress spoke , it spoke in <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
2011	*CLEME:	Here the agency has decided that it's going to accommodate a subset of
2012		the persons protected by <R_F_R_A> [= RFRA] .
2013	*CLEME:	In a choice between what Congress has provided and what the agency has
2014		done , the answer is clear .
