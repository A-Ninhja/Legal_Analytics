McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission

MS. MURPHY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 
please the Court:Bicker's aggregate contribution limits are an impermissible attempt to equalize the relative ability of individuals to participate in the political 
process. By prohibiting contributions that are within 
the modest base limits Congress has already imposed to 
combat the reality or appearance of corruption, these 
limits simply seek to prevent individuals from engaging 
in too much First Amendment activity.
 These limits cannot be justified on 
circumvention grounds because the concerns the 
Government hypothesizes are already addressed by 
Bicker's multitude of more direct anti-circumvention 
measures.
 JUSTICE BREYER: How is that?
