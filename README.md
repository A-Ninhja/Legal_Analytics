==========================

###What?

Taught at <a href="http://www.law.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Law</a>, Legal Analytics is designed to train students to efficiently manage, collect, explore and analyze various forms of legal data. Its purpose is to imbue students with the capability to: (1) understand the process of extracting knowledge from data with specific applications to domains such as legal prediction; (2) distinguish themselves in legal proceedings involving data or analysis; (3) distinguish themselves in firm management matters; (4) understand and communicate with information and software sector clients; and (5) use data to manage outside resources such as LPO or eDiscovery providers. Students will be introduced to sophisticated statistical techniques including machine learning and natural language processing.

This repository is for the storage of my projects and assignments related to Legal Analytics (Spring 2014).

###Why?

> When we study law we are not studying a mystery but a well-known profession. We are studying what we shall want in order to appear before judges, or to advise people in such a way as to keep them out of court. The reason why it is a profession, why people will pay lawyers to argue for them or to advise them, is that in societies like ours the command of the public force is intrusted to the judges in certain cases, and the whole power of the state will be put forth, if necessary, to carry out their judgments and decrees. People want to know under what circumstances and how far they will run the risk of coming against what is so much stronger than themselves, and hence it becomes a business to find out when this danger is to be feared. <strong>The object of our study, then, is prediction, the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts.</strong>
