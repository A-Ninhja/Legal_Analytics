Patrick Ellis' Legal Analytics (MSU Spring 2014) Repository

This repo is for the storage of assignments and projects related to Legal Analytics
taught at Michigan State University College of Law in the Spring 2014 semester.

This course is designed to train students to efficiently manage, collect, explore and analyze various forms of legal data. Its purpose is to imbue students with the capability to: (1) understand the process of extracting knowledge from data with specific applications to domains such as legal prediction; (2) distinguish themselves in legal proceedings involving data or analysis; (3) distinguish themselves in firm management matters; (4) understand and communicate with information and software sector clients; and (5) use data to manage outside resources such as LPO or eDiscovery providers. Students will be introduced to sophisticated statistical techniques including machine learning and natural language processing.
