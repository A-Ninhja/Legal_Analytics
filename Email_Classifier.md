# Purpose:         Code for Chapter 3. In this case we introduce the notion of binary classification.
#                   In machine learning this is a method for determining what of two categories a 
#                   given observation belongs to.  To show this, we will create a simple naive Bayes 
#                   classifier for SPAM email detection, and visualize the results.
# Data Used:       Email messages contained in data/ directory, source: http://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/
# Packages Used:   tm, ggplot2
